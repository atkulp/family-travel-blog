Class hasn’t actually started yet for students, but teachers continue to go to school and do administrative work and the like through most of the summer break.</p><p>My main, or “base”, school is called Minamikata Elementary School (南方小学校). There are 16 teachers including office staff and administrators. There’s one teacher for each grade, 1-6, who teach all subjects. There are two teachers for special needs students. There’s also a school nurse and a teaching assistant.</p><p>Everyone at Minamikata was extremely welcoming and helpful the entire day. I spent the first hour or so chatting with the principal and vice principal and getting an introduction to the school.</p><p>I have my own desk in the teacher’s room. In Japanese schools, the teachers move from room to room and the students stay in one place. As such, all teachers have their desks in one office instead of having desks in each classroom. Teachers spend most of their time in this room when students are on break. There were some students at school today, but only for club activities.</p><p>Most of the teachers at my school don’t really speak English. My Japanese isn’t amazing right now, but I’m sure after even a couple of weeks it will improve quite a bit simply from necessity! Nonetheless, I had a good time talking with the teachers and both asking and answering questions. I also had the opportunity to prepare for class.</p><p>Finally, after I showed an interest in sitting in on the kanji classes taught in the school to improve my own Japanese, one of the teachers brought me copies for the workbooks the students use. She also was so kind as to check my work after I finished each section, which was fun for both of us.</p><p>Overall I had a good first day, and I’m looking forward to the coming year. I’ll be posting photos once I’ve confirmed what is and is not ok to post online with my principal.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/yosakoi-festival/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Yosakoi Festival</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/settling-into-the-work-routine/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Settling into the work routine</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/first-week-of-work/index.html" class="invert">First week of work!</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-02T04:13">September 2, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
