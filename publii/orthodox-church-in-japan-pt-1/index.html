I think this will probably end up being a series of posts because there’s a lot to share. Keep an eye out for some more posts with more artists of the Church here covered.</p><p>It’s been about a month now and we’ve finally managed to make it to all of the churches in the area. The first liturgy we went to was in Ishinomaki, which is a bit of a drive south of us but isn’t too bad. We tried to avoid toll ways and ended up taking a longer route than necessary as the road we thought had a toll ended up not, so it’s about a 25-30 min drive normally. For our first visits, we tried to arrive a bit early to give us a chance to meet some of the parishioners.</p><p>Father Luke (神父のルカ 田畑 隆平) has been very understanding of our situation and his English is good enough to convey important information. He’s asked me to read hours in English before liturgy at most parishes, which was interesting. The singing is also interesting at an the parishes, it’s all from the heart, but also unison, slow, and on a collection of pitches. Everywhere has been thrilled to have some new singers.</p><p>On that note, Father has 5 churches in the surrounding area: Ishinomaki, Kurihara, Takashimizu, Sanuma, and a few more. They’re all within a 30 min drive from us, so nothing too terrible, and they all have very small congregations.</p><h2>Ishinomaki – 石巻</h2><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/IMG_20190901_091107179_HDR-1-scaled.jpg" alt="The font of St. John the Theologian in Ishinomaki" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190901_091107179_HDR-1-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190901_091107179_HDR-1-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190901_091107179_HDR-1-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190901_091107179_HDR-1-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>The church in Ishinomaki has some interesting history attached to it. The original building is still standing but is not being used as the church building anymore because the state took control of it. It’s currently a museum and is the oldest standing Christian church in Japan. We’ll go there at some point and take some pictures.</p><p>The size of the congregations here is quite different from what we get in the US. Many Japanese people, even to this day, do not have cars so most parishioners walk to church. Very often the only cars in the lot are Father’s and ours. As such, 5 people seems be a rough average with some parishes being much smaller and some being a bit bigger. Obviously Tokyo, Sendai, and the other large cities have larger congregations but they also have transit systems so….</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/IMG_20190901_092451437-scaled.jpg" alt="Interior of St. John the Theologian.

Lilly was in Sendai for JET stuff, so I walked the 17 min to get there alone. Once there it quickly became clear that it was actually liturgy, so that was a fun realization. Since the congregation here was 2-3 people, Father had to lead the choir as well as do everything else. He refuses to allow me to serve because, “no one ever serves at these parishes”.</p><p>This church was definitely the smallest I’ve been to, but the building is still large enough to accommodate a decent number of people. It’s possible that the small turnout was because it was a weekday liturgy or because it was firing the week of Oban (a family holiday). The next Sunday liturgy here is the end of the month, so we’ll see then.</p><p>There doesn’t seem to always be a meal afterward services. Some places have, others haven’t. Sanuma did have a meal afterwards, someone walked to the 7-11 nearby and grabbed box lunches for us, as well as mugicha (麦茶), or roasted barley tea, and some desserts. I got to talk with Father for a bit and learned more about orthodoxy in Japan as well as more info on the other churches he serves.</p><h2>Takashimizu (in Kurihara) – 高清水</h2><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/IMG_20190825_120847282_HDR-1024x768.jpg" alt="The exterior of the Church of the Transfiguration in Takashimizu, someone biked" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190825_120847282_HDR-1024x768-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190825_120847282_HDR-1024x768-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190825_120847282_HDR-1024x768-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190825_120847282_HDR-1024x768-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>This church is smaller than Ishnomaki, but larger than ours in town. The building is still the only one we’ve seen not purpose built to be a church: it was clearly a house at some point that was gutted and converted. That said, it’s still nice inside and is the only place with all tatami floors.</p><p>This church is nestled into a small village kinda in the mountains a bit, so the town itself was tiny. It also only has one emergency radio broadcast tower, which is apparently right next to the church, and they decided to test it as I was reading post-communion prayers.</p><h2>Wakuya – 涌谷</h2><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/IMG_20190908_115957222_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="My lovely wife and the exterior of the church of St. Isaiah in Wakuya" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115957222_HDR-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115957222_HDR-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115957222_HDR-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115957222_HDR-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>This is probably the largest church in Father’s area. You know it’s large because it has two readers and an alter server (his boy is too young without someone helping him). It’s also on a larger road and the doors of the church open right onto the sidewalk which probably helps.</p><p>After the service, we went over to the hall and had a meal. This meal was actually more of a potluck, there were pickles, a seafood salad with tiny fish, and some other things that parishioners brought. Afterwards Father led a choir practice for the congregation on tone 8 (what they would be singing in a few weeks when the next liturgy happened there).</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/IMG_20190908_115939592-scaled.jpg" alt="Walking into the church, Matushka is peaking out on the right" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115939592-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115939592-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115939592-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/31/responsive/IMG_20190908_115939592-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Also, going back to our time in Tokyo. I did get to go visit Nikolaido (Holy Resurrection Cathedral), but considering the length of this post, I think I’ll make another one to cover that. I also wasn’t able to make it to a service, so I’ll have more to say later!</p><p>Also, I’ll try to watch comments better, so if there’s anything people are curious about feel free to ask!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/swazi-fire/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Swazi Fire!</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/changing-with-the-seasons/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Changing With the Seasons</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/family-christmas-in-japan/index.html" class="invert">Family Christmas in Japan</a></h4><time datetime="2020-01-03T09:31">January 3, 2020</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/orthodox-church-in-japan-pt-2/index.html" class="invert">Orthodox Church in Japan – Pt. 2</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-23T05:52">September 23, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/cooking-in-japan-ri-ben-deliao-li-suru/index.html" class="invert">Cooking in Japan – 日本で料理する</a></h4><time datetime="2019-10-26T12:08">October 26, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
