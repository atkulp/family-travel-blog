It’s not quite so straightforward, though. Here are the real results of our time abroad:</p><ul><li>By living in a very different place, we simply learned more about how the world can function. It turns out that near-anarchy (no traffic laws, no sanitation laws, no zoning, etc.) can kinda work. We think that the West should have more Nepali-style buildings with flat roofs for hanging out on, clotheslines, solar water heating, no central heating or AC, etc. These buildings have a smaller environmental impact with minimal impact on comfort (in the right climate, anyway).</li><li>We have new confidence that we can figure out food/water safety, public transit, taxis, restaurants, etc. just about anywhere.</li><li>We’ve had lots of time to learn about, talk about, and reflect on religions (mostly Buddhism). We’re happy to talk your ear off about it anytime.</li><li>We have an alarming amount of Kathmandu dust and pollution in our lungs. In general, our immune systems have been through a lot, possibly for the better.</li><li>Seeing suffering people and animals every day strongly reminded us to help others as much as possible.</li><li>We have very mixed feelings about future travel. On one hand, we love Oregon and we’ve had enough of the hassles of traveling (not to mention the expense and environmental impact). On the other hand, we find ourselves absentmindedly looking up job openings in Estonia and Singapore.</li><li>While still in Nepal, as we were planning our travels to Japan, we expected that we would lightheartedly joke about the cultural transition. Nope, we had a genuinely difficult time adjusting to all the differences! We both caught ourselves nodding sideways (the Nepali way) on several occasions. We felt indignant that we had just gone through all this effort to learn a new language (Nepali), yet we still couldn’t understand the (Japanese) speech of the people around us. It was hard, but it also provided a convenient transition period to minimize culture shock in the States.</li><li>We stayed in Nepal for just the right amount of time. We thoroughly enjoyed having enough time to truly settle into Boudha, but Nepal doesn’t feel like home.</li><li>Similarly, we studied religion for just the right amount of time. It was really wonderful to be immersed in the monastery school and debate with nuns over lunch. At the same time, it feels good to study technology, math, and science again.</li><li>To generalize, we reaffirmed the importance of balance. In the past, we wished for more chances to explore the world and more time to think about topics like religion, philosophy, and anthropology; I missed learning languages. In Nepal, though, we missed family+friends, the coziness of crafting, our musical instruments, and tech+math+science. It’ll be an ongoing challenge to give all of these priorities the attention they deserve.</li></ul><h2>Our New Living Arrangement</h2><p>We really lucked out! Our university’s family housing has a waitlist over a year long and we made it to the top right on time. Additionally, there are a variety of sizes and costs to the units, and you have to take the one that’s available when you finish your wait. We got the perfect size and budget, and our particular unit was remodeled right before we moved in!</p><p>So now we have a nice one-bedroom apartment that’s about a 7-minute walk from the edge of campus, on a quiet street, with good internet, and all utilities included. We’re having a good time making the space our own (by cooking a lot of Nepali food, for example).</p><p>Unfortunately, Kendrea’s had to spend a lot of time out of the apartment. More on that after the pictures.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/img_5096-scaled.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5096-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5096-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5096-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5096-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/img_5092-1-8-scaled.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5092-1-8-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5092-1-8-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5092-1-8-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5092-1-8-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/img_5091-1-8-scaled.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5091-1-8-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5091-1-8-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5091-1-8-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5091-1-8-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/img_5212-scaled.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5212-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5212-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5212-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/50/responsive/img_5212-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h2>What We’re Up To</h2><h4>Gabriel</h4><p>I have quite the set of classes compared to what we took in Nepal! I’m taking a full course load of computer science, physics, and (surprisingly) geography. Here’s a brief description of each:</p><ul><li><strong>Analysis of Algorithms</strong>: Basically the class so far has been, “here’s an impossible-sounding task. Solve it.” followed by confusion, then ideas, then a solution. Some people complain that this kind of work won’t be useful in industry, but I only really want a job where it would be…</li><li><strong>Programming Language Fundamentals</strong>: Programming is telling a computer what to do. There are many different philosophies to accomplish this, and this class talks about the unique challenges in defining and evaluating the grammar and semantics of a language.</li><li><strong>Energy Alternatives</strong>: A 7-person physics colloquium about the physical limits of classical and alternative energy sources. We talk about the benefits and drawbacks of coal, natural gas, hydro, wave, geothermal, wind, solar, nuclear, biomass, and many other sources of energy.</li><li><strong>The Weird World of Quantum Mechanics</strong>: Another very small physics colloquium about the nature of reality at the smallest testable and verifiable scale. In contrast to most other physics classes, the only inclusion of math is to demonstrate relationships. The class is mostly theory and discussion. The same professor teaches colloquia other terms about the physics and philosophy of time and consciousness.</li><li><strong>Geography of International Development and Globalization</strong>: Why are some countries rich and others poor? How have people tried to explain this in the past, and what did they get wrong? This class is about how the expansion of capitalism and colonialism left marks on the globalized world we’re in today. There’s also a lot of discussion of the effects of a growing population and shifting labor market. Each student picks a country to focus on throughout the term, so I picked Eswatini!</li></ul><p>I’ve been surviving the transition from monastery coursework alright, and I got used to having an apartment right by campus pretty quickly. My proximity has also facilitates extracurriculars like participation in security club.</p><p>I’m studying computer science with a focus on computer security. This term, through the security club, I’ve joined a group of six other students to compete in the Pacific Rim Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, in which you take on the task of running a mock company’s server infrastructure in the face of professional hackers… who are way better at attacking than anyone is at defending. And they’re also scouts from big companies looking to hire. And you have to defend the network for two 8-hour blocks over a weekend. We did well in the qualifiers last week, and everyone is optimistic about our performance in Seattle coming up at the end of March.</p><h4>Kendrea</h4><p>I’m working at <a href="http://galois.com">Galois</a>! Surprise! Gabriel and I have been excited about Galois for a long time now. I received an internship offer while in Japan; as of February 2, I’ve now finished two weeks of a ten-week internship. It’s a shame that I have to spend 3-5 days a week in Portland so soon after arriving in the States, but it’s worth it to hang out with a concentrated group of ridiculously kind and smart people. My goal is to sneakily convince them that Gabriel, as a fellow ridiculously kind and smart person, belongs there, too. I’ve spent most of my work time so far studying up on functional programming (Scala), abstract algebra (category theory), and epistemology (Quine). I’m working with a philosopher at a tech company named after a mathematician—I love that I usually can’t even tell if I’m doing philosophy, computer science, or math! Just today, I jumped in on a new project to consolidate models in an effort to identify interventions that would alleviate food insecurity in Ethiopia.</p><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>…for following along, listening to our stories, and supporting us!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/nepal/index.html">nepal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/the-halfway-point/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">The halfway point</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/coronavirus/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Coronavirus</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/gabriel-and-kendrea/index.html" class="invert" title="Gabriel and Kendrea">Gabriel and Kendrea</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/homestay-here-to-stay/index.html" class="invert">Homestay: Here to Stay</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-29T09:44">August 29, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/last-day/index.html" class="invert">Last Day</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-02T18:47">August 2, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
