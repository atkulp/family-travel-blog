Young maidens march from their villages to collect reeds which they then take to the Queen Mother’s palace to be used to build up the outer wall. They march 30km (10km for the younger ones) in regiments often while singing, then camping out for during the nights. The explanation is that the festival will encourage them to remain sexually inactive, show reverence for the queen, and build solidarity. The entire ceremony is 8 days with the girls marching, cutting the reeds, presenting them to the queen, and preparing for days 6 and 7 where they dance. On day 7 they dance at an arena within the royal compound with spectators and the king present. On the 8th day the king commands cows to be slaughtered and the girls receive a portion of the meat and head back home.</p><p>The stress on the virginal aspect of it (in modern days) relates to their efforts to reduce the transmission of HIV. They also encourage men to be celibate. Their rate of infection is the highest in the world and they are working very hard to bring that down. There is already a measurable improvement in their new infection rate.</p><p>Karen and I took a khumbi from Mbabane to the event, a trip of about 40 minutes or so. On the way, we chatted a little with a guy sitting next to me. It turns out he’s from Rwanda and he was very helpful knowing when to get off, where to go, and what was happening!</p><p>From the khumbi stop at the dead end of a dirt road, we starting walking down a path that quickly opened up into another road. Along the road were dilapidated houses and shops, litter, and an inexplicable stream of water running down the center. Despite its humble look, we felt safe and only experienced friendliness or indifference from the residents. We were among <em>many</em> other people heading to the royal residence. It was a bit striking how close this area was with such contrast.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_124941-1-1024x469-1024x469-1.jpg" alt="Large numbers of people passed through on their way" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_124941-1-1024x469-1024x469-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_124941-1-1024x469-1024x469-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_124941-1-1024x469-1024x469-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_124941-1-1024x469-1024x469-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>We spotted an untethered cow, and then a chicken as we walked.

We walked a decent distance not having any idea what we were looking for exactly or when we would arrive.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_125710-1-1024x390-1024x390-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_125710-1-1024x390-1024x390-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_125710-1-1024x390-1024x390-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_125710-1-1024x390-1024x390-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_125710-1-1024x390-1024x390-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>At some point we heard the sound of many people. We turned around to see a large number of people coming toward us — the first group! As they got closer, we could hear that they were singing. It continues to amaze us how wonderful the singing in eSwatini is. This was no exception.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_1258222-1024x600-1024x600-1.jpg" alt="The colorful decorations of the maidens were quite striking" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1258222-1024x600-1024x600-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1258222-1024x600-1024x600-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1258222-1024x600-1024x600-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1258222-1024x600-1024x600-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Girls were divided into groups of 8-13 year olds and 14-22 year olds. Regiments each had their own uniforms and song that they sang.

It was a minimum of clothing which probably felt good in the hot sun. There is much pride in the outfits, and the topless nature of it looks from the outside to be evidence of positive body image, and a sense of empowerment. This isn’t about being sexually alluring — it’s about them being themselves and embracing their femininity.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_1312232-1024x768-1024x768-1.jpg" alt="The girls were clearly having fun and many excitedly wanted to be photographed" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1312232-1024x768-1024x768-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1312232-1024x768-1024x768-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1312232-1024x768-1024x768-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1312232-1024x768-1024x768-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Once at the arena, the girls marched around the field, in front of the spectators, then to the back where they stayed. Groups sang and danced as they walked past. The field got more and more full as the afternoon wore on. There was so much great singing and excitement. Smiles were found not only on the field, but all around.</p><p>It was very cute seeing the really young girls (I think perhaps too young to participate) running out from the stands to march with them anyway, then running back even happier. Pairs and small groups of them would gather together and walk around the stands perhaps going between different people they knew in the seats.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/MVIMG_20190902_160258-2.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_160258-2-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_160258-2-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_160258-2-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_160258-2-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/MVIMG_20190902_154500-1024x768-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_154500-1024x768-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_154500-1024x768-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_154500-1024x768-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_154500-1024x768-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/MVIMG_20190902_1530182-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1530182-1024x576-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1530182-1024x576-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1530182-1024x576-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1530182-1024x576-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/MVIMG_20190902_1342493-1024x575-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1342493-1024x575-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1342493-1024x575-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1342493-1024x575-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1342493-1024x575-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_142102-1024x469-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_142102-1024x469-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_142102-1024x469-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_142102-1024x469-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_142102-1024x469-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/IMG_20190902_1440512-1024x469-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1440512-1024x469-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1440512-1024x469-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1440512-1024x469-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/IMG_20190902_1440512-1024x469-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/MVIMG_20190902_1503402-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1503402-1024x576-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1503402-1024x576-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1503402-1024x576-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/38/responsive/MVIMG_20190902_1503402-1024x576-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>At the end, the king came down and did his own dance and went around inspecting the groups. Some years he chooses a wife from those assembled, but not this year. I’m not really sure how all of that works but there is also input from his mother and various advisers so I don’t think it’s as simple as just seeing a pretty girl.</p><p>It’s easy to see why this is such an important event for the Swazi people. It’s a wonderful showing of national pride and clearly an exciting event for the girls who participate.
