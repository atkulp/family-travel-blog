Devouring all of the fantasy and sci-fi novels I could get my hands on from the age of ten, I’ve built up quite a hefty collection of books that I now have to lug along wherever I move. Not content with the cold touch of an e-book, I’ve always preferred to read physical copies of all of my favorite books. I’ve read my first copy of Eragon, my all time favorite book, so many times I had to buy a second copy because the first is literally falling apart.</p><p>Noticeably absent from my voluminous collection, however, is even a single volume of manga. For those who are as yet unaware, manga is a Japanese style of graphic novel. Manga is a term that covers all ranges of fiction genres, and I’m sure some non fiction as well. I discovered manga in middle school while working as a library assistant, and I’ve loved the medium ever since.</p><p>Like many graphic novels, a single series of manga can span anywhere from 2 volumes to 100. This is in part because manga are also serialized, meaning one chapter is released regularly and compiled into a volume later. The longest running manga will typically run around 300 chapters, though there are those that have topped 1000. In order to have the complete series of a manga, one would need to buy all the volumes, or all of the copies of the serialized version.</p><p>This is where tragedy strikes. In the United States, not only are manga difficult to find in English, let alone Japanese, but they’re also rather expensive. $4-8 a volume doesn’t sound like much until you need to buy 27 of them! When you can buy normal print books for $20 ish dollars new, why would you buy a used set of manga for more than $100? As such, I’ve only ever owned 5 or 10 volumes of manga, and never a complete series.</p><p>Until now.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/img_20190913_2153541693822045367090299-scaled.jpg" alt="88 volumes of manga" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/img_20190913_2153541693822045367090299-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/img_20190913_2153541693822045367090299-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/img_20190913_2153541693822045367090299-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/img_20190913_2153541693822045367090299-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Incidentally, in Japan, manga are very common and used goods are rather cheap. Today, Damian and I decided to go by a used book store on a whim after dinner, just to see what was on offer. They were having an absolutely ridiculous sale, where all manga currently priced at ¥50 ($0.50) were marked down to ¥10. Yes, that’s right. Roughly equivalent to $0.10 per volume. %0.025 of the price of a single used volume in English in the States.</p><p>I went a bit nuts.</p><p>I did buy a few more normally priced volumes, around ¥100, but this sale was targeted directly at me, and I embraced it. In total I bought <strong>88 volumes</strong> of manga. The cost of all 88 volumes came out to be about $30, or ¥3000. 88 volumes for $30. In the States, at the used price of $4 per volume, I would have spent $352.</p><p>I’m not sure how else to describe my current state of mind other than elated, but a picture is worth a thousand words, so I’ll wrap this up with one. Now I just need to figure out how to get all of these home!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/line_p20190913_2159210347385018976424690030.jpg" alt="Manga in bags in our hallway" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/line_p20190913_2159210347385018976424690030-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/line_p20190913_2159210347385018976424690030-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/line_p20190913_2159210347385018976424690030-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/30/responsive/line_p20190913_2159210347385018976424690030-lg.webp 1024w"></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/what-were-here-for-classes/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">What We’re Here For: Classes</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/dog-dog-dog-dog/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Dog dog dog dog</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
