My parents wanted to spend some time in Japan being a tourist on their way out to meet up with us (they arrived 5 days before Gabriel and Kendrea) so they looked into various attractions in Narita (where they landed), Tokyo (where they could catch a train to Sendai), and other places along the way. In their research, they found a site claiming that the Emperors palace is open on December 23rd due to it being the Emperors birthday. Since the palace is pretty much always closed to the public, Lilly and I thought that sounded really neat and wanted to go see the palace as well.</p><p>In preparation for the trip, Lilly found a good AirBNB house that was a bit on the outskirts of Tokyo but still had train access. This allowed us to have easy access to Tokyo without needing to pay tons of money to actually be in Tokyo. The house was two stories and had two bedrooms, pretty much a perfect match for our needs!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/airBNB-house-outside.jpg" alt="Outside of the AirBNB house, we had the whole thing to ourselves." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/airBNB-house-outside-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/airBNB-house-outside-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/airBNB-house-outside-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/airBNB-house-outside-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h2>Saturday</h2><p>For those that aren’t aware, our apartment in Tome is about 5 hours north of Tokyo by car, and there are tolls along the way that add up to almost $100! That said, it’s still cheaper than buying two Shinkansen ( 新幹線 : bullet train) tickets as those are over $100 per person. It is a pretty drive though, with lots of mountains along the way. Though we didn’t get to appreciate the views very much as we left around 5am in an attempt to get to Tokyo around 10 am alternated sleeping in the car.</p><p>Traffic didn’t quite play along nicely as we got into Tokyo, and we had to stop and get gas, so it ended up being closer to 11 am by the time we made it to the house. From there, Lilly and I left the car parked in the lot at the house and took the train to Tokyo Station to meet up with my parents. We didn’t quite time things right with them and ended up waiting at the station for a bit before my parents arrived, but they did finally make it.</p><p>For dinner that night we went to yakiniku ( 焼肉 : grilled meat) which is similar to Korean BBQ in the States, except that they don’t use Korean spices or cuts of meat. One of the favorites was gyūtan (牛タン : cow tongue) which has almost no fat, marbled or otherwise, unlike most cuts of meat in Japan.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/Yakinikuwiki.jpg" alt="Traditional grills have live coals under a wire grill and people use metal tongs to grill the food" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Yakinikuwiki-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Yakinikuwiki-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Yakinikuwiki-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Yakinikuwiki-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/Gyutan_teishoku.jpg" alt="Gyūtan with the usual cuts to make the meat a little more edible.

The cathedral is the seat of Metropolitan Daniel of the Japanese Orthodox Church, though he was actually at the hospital that day and we didn’t get to see him. As such, it wasn’t a hierarchical service, but it was still very nice and the choir was very good!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/Holy_Resurrection_Cathedral_in_Tokyo.jpg" alt="View as you walk up to the cathedral.

There’s also a deacon from America that serves at the cathedral and he did a litany in English. We were less fortunate with the priests giving confession, but they knew enough to ask our names, verify we were orthodox, and give a blessing.</p><p>Lilly and I would like to go back to Nikorai-do at some point for a service with the Metropolitan serving, but that will have to be another trip.</p><p>After the service we found some breakfast that didn’t have gluten and then walked around the part of Tokyo that the church is in, as well as took a trip down the train line a bit to see more.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/sunday-walking.jpg" alt="Selfie overlooking a channel as we were walking to Akihabara" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sunday-walking-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sunday-walking-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sunday-walking-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sunday-walking-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>The first place we went was Akihabara (秋葉原) as it’s within walking distance from the church. Though known for a few things, we were mostly interested in the electronics part. We found a few hole-in-the-wall type shops, one of which ended up being a super packed little mall (complete with escalators) with tons of different types of shops inside. A lot of the shops were closed since it was Sunday, but we did get to see some fun and interesting stuff!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/akihabara-neo-geo.jpg" alt="A free Neo-Geo (no coins required) tucked away in a small shop in Akihabara" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/akihabara-neo-geo-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/akihabara-neo-geo-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/akihabara-neo-geo-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/akihabara-neo-geo-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>After spending some time poking around shops, we went to the Edo-Tokyo Museum to see some history for the area. The museum covers from 1590 through 1964 showing everything from models of the city layout; to artifacts like clothing, pottery, and buildings; to old electronics; to school lunches through the years.

The area directly behind the gate has a whole bunch of shops (though we apparently didn’t get any pictures of that part), and after them another gate, followed by shops selling stuff more closely related to the temple, and finally the temple itself. Buddhist temples have lots of gold in the inside, though people don’t really go into the temples and shrines in Japan except for ceremonies.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"

day getting dinner at a nearby restaurant and got to introduce a few more interesting Japanese dishes as well as absorb more cigarette smoke than I think I have in my entire life up until now combined.</p><h2>Monday</h2><p>Monday was supposed to be our day to visit the Emperor’s Palace, but apparently that wasn’t to be. Since the old Emperor abdicated this year, his son ascended the throne and the new day is some time in February…. Not exactly compatible with our plans for the day! So since our original plans were foiled, we had to find some other things to fill the day with.</p><p>Our first thought was to go to Ueno Park (上野公園) and visit either the zoo or the one of the museums there, but apparently lots of things that stay open on the weekend choose Monday to be their day off. So pretty much everything in Ueno Park was closed. The only thing in the park that we could see was the shrine, so we poked our heads in and took a quick look around.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/ueno-shrine.jpg" alt="This building at the Ueno Park shrine has clearly had a new copper roof put on.

This was pretty much the only open air market we’ve seen like it in Japan thus far. There were lots of seafood stalls, meat stalls, some stalls selling trinkets and American-style goods, and some restaurants.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/ameya-yokocho.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/ameya-yokocho-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/ameya-yokocho-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/ameya-yokocho-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/ameya-yokocho-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/grilled-and-smoked-meat-stall.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/grilled-and-smoked-meat-stall-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/grilled-and-smoked-meat-stall-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/grilled-and-smoked-meat-stall-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/grilled-and-smoked-meat-stall-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/sea-food-stall.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sea-food-stall-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sea-food-stall-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sea-food-stall-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/sea-food-stall-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/another-seafood-stall.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/another-seafood-stall-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/another-seafood-stall-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/another-seafood-stall-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/another-seafood-stall-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>From there we took a train down to the Tokyo Skytree (東京スカイツリ) which is the tallest tower, and the second largest structure in the world (according the Wikipedia anyway). In the basement of the train station there, we saw a very cool candy making shop that had someone making candy as people watched. We then went upstairs and found lunch at some food carts at the base of the tower. They even had some gluten free food which was good!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/Tokyo_Skytree.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Tokyo_Skytree-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Tokyo_Skytree-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Tokyo_Skytree-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/Tokyo_Skytree-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/candy-maker.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/candy-maker-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/candy-maker-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/candy-maker-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/candy-maker-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/finished-candy.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/finished-candy-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/finished-candy-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/finished-candy-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/finished-candy-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/hard-candy.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/hard-candy-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/hard-candy-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/hard-candy-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/hard-candy-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>After that we started our long trip home, but we did stop briefly along the way at Kawagoe (川越市), specifically Koedo (小江戸) which means “Little Edo” as it’s the only surviving section of Edo period Tokyo. The houses and shops all date back to the 1600’s or earlier! We didn’t get to look around that much as it was late and most everything was closed, but we did get to see some really neat old buildings and we did stop at an open shop to look around a bit!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/45914575071_bf2b4cbc0c_b.jpg" alt="Koedo at night, lots of old wooden buildings!" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/45914575071_bf2b4cbc0c_b-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/45914575071_bf2b4cbc0c_b-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/45914575071_bf2b4cbc0c_b-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/61/responsive/45914575071_bf2b4cbc0c_b-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Sorry this was a long post, we packed a lot into those three days! It was the longest trip Lilly and I have taken from home and we definitely trust our little “Kei” car much more now that’s it’s proven that it can make long trips. We’re definitely going to have more road trips as we explore more of Japan!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on October 2, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/family-christmas-in-japan/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Family Christmas in Japan</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/january-in-eswatini/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">January in Eswatini</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tokyo/index.html" class="invert">Tokyo</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-04T10:40">August 4, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
