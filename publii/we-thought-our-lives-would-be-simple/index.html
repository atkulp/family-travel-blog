In no particular order…</p><ul><li>We went on a field trip today in our Buddhist History and Culture class. We walked five minutes down the road to a grand monastery that we hadn’t seen before. All 44 students settled into a small temple with three huge golden statues (sorry, no pictures allowed!) and read (aloud and in unison) the Buddha’s narration of his own enlightenment. What an excellent way to take advantage of the school’s location! Right behind us, several monks performed a puja (ceremony). We’d like to say that the traditional Tibetan horns playing in the background created a lovely spiritual atmosphere, but no, they were just super loud and clashed obnoxiously. Maybe we’ll grow to like them??</li><li>We can now write in Devanagari (the Nepali alphabet)! Nepali class is definitely the most fun and engaging.</li><li>Khenpo class is neat. It’s less organized than I expected — a learned Tibetan monk just talks about a text (“The Way of the Bodhisattva” by Shantideva), word by word, for 1.5 hours every day. We enjoy hearing his belly laugh, stories, friendly dialogue with the translator, and of course his vast stores of teachings.</li><li>Gabriel had his first Anthropology of Nepalese Religions class today with Fr. Greg. He says it was “superb”, so especially because I’ve taken a Buddhist Ethics class at OSU already, I think I’ll switch out of Ethics to join Anthropology! I also plan to switch out of Buddhist History and Culture to join Fundamentals of Buddhist Philosophy.</li><li>On Saturday, we had exactly the sort of immersive experience we’d hoped for! First, we attended a 3.5-hour teaching by the esteemed Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche. He radiates compassion, and we received plenty of it because we sat in the very front with the other new students. He runs a 500-monk monastery, RYI, an online dharma training program, several dharma institutions outside of Nepal, a charity that helps people and animals in Nepal, and perhaps Earth. We would have enjoyed the teaching more if he hadn’t arrived a half hour late and we hadn’t been sitting painfully on the floor the entire time… After the teaching, we met up with three classmates to work on a reflection paper over a phở lunch by the stupa. We had an amazing two-hour discussion with a nun of Korean heritage from New York, a nun from the Nepali side of the Himalayas, and a laywoman from the Kathmandu Valley. The first nun had zero patience for Western academic analysis of Buddhism, which was fascinating to hear and to (very sensitively) argue against. At one point, she gave a little speech about dance in Buddhism that perfectly mirrored something that Gabriel’s priest uncle had said to us a couple months ago about singing in Orthodox Christianity. All in all, super cool, and now we have a few new friends. (Tiring, though… I fell asleep at 6:30pm that night.)</li><li>So much Buddhism. Although we’re glad that we’ve set aside four months to study this fascinating subject, we definitely look forward to returning to computer science once we get home! This is actually the perfect situation — we’re diving into another culture while affirming our career paths.</li></ul><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/c2c6eaaf-52a4-46d7-b3cd-ce635d830bd0.jpg" alt="Beard trimming on our balcony" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/c2c6eaaf-52a4-46d7-b3cd-ce635d830bd0-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/c2c6eaaf-52a4-46d7-b3cd-ce635d830bd0-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/c2c6eaaf-52a4-46d7-b3cd-ce635d830bd0-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/c2c6eaaf-52a4-46d7-b3cd-ce635d830bd0-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h2>Boudha Community Choir</h2><p>We found a choir!! Good news for my mental health!</p><p>We rehearse weekly at someone’s house. The choir has about 30 members, mostly from America and Europe. Many of them attend or teach at RYI. We’re preparing for a Christmas concert, and I think the choir is somehow associated with a local church; it’s really nice to have some exposure to familiar Western Christian culture. The choir isn’t gonna win any advanced musicianship awards, but that’s okay!</p><p>Best part: we’re singing “Bogoroditse Devo”. During our wedding two months ago, the wedding choir sang it for us as we entered the church. So excited!</p><h2>Swing Society</h2><p>We taught a dance class! Yuki is an accomplished dancer and fellow member of the Corvallis Swing Society. She had the idea and motivation to begin a Swing Society at RYI. On Sunday, she, Gabriel, and I taught the basics of single-count swing to three students (we’ll advertise better for next week) in the monastery restaurant’s meditation/activity room. They learned a ton in a short time, we hung out with a stray dog, I remembered to bring my portable speaker, we ran home in the pouring monsoon rain in the dark, and we had lots of fun.</p><h2>Some slight updates/clarifications/corrections about the home situation</h2><ol><li>Gabriel and I, as outcastes, are not allowed to be involved in the process of cooking in this high-caste (Brahmin) Hindu house. It’s fine if we are in the kitchen area. Our bedroom is ours, but the kitchen and dining room belong to the grandma. Her house, her rules. I have to let her know when I’m on my period so that she can serve me food in a room off to the side — if I touched the dining table while I was on my period, I’d pollute it. (According to our Nepali language professor, many Brahmins these days are no longer this strict about purity.)</li><li>The grandma has at least three “helpers”: Saili (always around), Laxmi (sometimes around), and a lady I just met today who apparently works in the garden. All of them are Brahmins. This explains why they are allowed to help in the kitchen!</li><li>Again, all the purity stuff is Hindu; Buddhism doesn’t have castes. I’m writing about it because it’s striking to us, and it’s probably more interesting to read about than the way that Nepalis do their laundry or something.</li><li>Roshan’s 12-year-old son, Pragoon, comes over pretty often, too. He and Ishan (Milan’s son; Pragoon’s cousin) are very close, and they play video games on their tablets together all the time.</li><li>We still interact with only the grandma 90% of the time, and then only over meals. I really hope that we don’t seem antisocial!</li></ol><h2>Real Talk</h2><p>After three weeks, my body is still having a hard time adapting to the new country. Sitting on the ground hurts — I’m not sure whether to blame weak back muscles or scoliosis. I’ve needed a lot of sleep: upwards of 9 hours every day. The humidity makes us sweat and makes the scary-disease-carrying mosquitos happy. I’m glad that we aren’t expected to go on adventures across the city now that orientation is over, because those taxed me to my physical and mental limit. Gabriel and I have both had mild colds and severe headaches. We’re very glad that we haven’t had any stomach bugs or severe illnesses (yet)! Sometimes we’ve struggled to find enough time alone to recharge our introverted selves. We’ve had to adapt to different food: the current meal plan is a large serving of dal bhat tarkari (rice or flatbread, lentils, and various vegetable curries) in the morning, a small serving of whatever-the-monastery-restaurant-happens-to-have-today at 12:30, and another large serving of dal bhat tarkari in the late evening.</p><p>I say all this not to complain, but to show that moving across the world has physical consequences, even if you don’t get sick! Travelers, please take care; people at home, enjoy your ability to more easily take care 🙂</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/1901114b-174e-4096-bf3d-8edc2cf9b035.jpg" alt="Beautiful monsoon light and a rainbow" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/1901114b-174e-4096-bf3d-8edc2cf9b035-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/1901114b-174e-4096-bf3d-8edc2cf9b035-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/1901114b-174e-4096-bf3d-8edc2cf9b035-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/40/responsive/1901114b-174e-4096-bf3d-8edc2cf9b035-lg.webp 1024w"></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/nepal/index.html">nepal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/umhlanga-reed-festival/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Umhlanga (Reed Festival)</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/were-alive/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">We’re alive</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/gabriel-and-kendrea/index.html" class="invert" title="Gabriel and Kendrea">Gabriel and Kendrea</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
