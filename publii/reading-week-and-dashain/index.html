As spelled in Nepali, is should be pronounced DAH-saii with the the “ii” pronounced nasally, but the “Dashain” transliteration is pervasive. Nepalis (very confusingly) swap “s” and “sh” all the time, and transliterating the nasal is often done by adding “-n” or “-ng”.</p><p>Even though the school is affiliated with a Buddhist monastery, we still get the week off; This is similar to Americans getting winter break, regardless of religion. There are some Hindus working and studying at the school, so it wouldn’t be fair to them! Plus the semester is long and we need a break; why not make the break and the holiday line up?</p><p>Dashain is the time of year for visiting family, feasting, swinging on bamboo swings, flying kites, worshiping, and offering animal sacrifices. For us, this means the businesses are closed, the transit is busy, there are occasional headless goats on the sidewalk, family members visit (we were never introduced), there are animal guts on the kitchen floor, and we get a blessing from our elder, the grandma of the house.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/59220774759__6c71e8b8-0450-4ff9-bd52-3e323c210dcb-e1571860050857-768x1024-1.jpg" alt="Orthodox Christian wedding rings, Buddhist sacred thread from the nunnery, and Hindu tikka+grass+money+apple… we’re just getting showered with blessings!" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/59220774759__6c71e8b8-0450-4ff9-bd52-3e323c210dcb-e1571860050857-768x1024-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/59220774759__6c71e8b8-0450-4ff9-bd52-3e323c210dcb-e1571860050857-768x1024-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/59220774759__6c71e8b8-0450-4ff9-bd52-3e323c210dcb-e1571860050857-768x1024-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/59220774759__6c71e8b8-0450-4ff9-bd52-3e323c210dcb-e1571860050857-768x1024-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/img_4262-e1571860031248-768x1024-1.jpg" alt="*We got to try out a Dashain swing!

Her laptop wouldn’t turn on and my phone wouldn’t stop turning on (boot loop). Both without provocation.</p><p>For the laptop, she was only really missing a few weeks of notes, since they hadn’t synced in a while. We went to a repair place in a fancy part of Kathmandu, and it turns out there was a screen recall! If that’s the issue (and it seems to be), the repair is free. We just have to wait two weeks for the part to ship from Singapore… Thankfully we had the opportunity to use a temporary workaround and get the screen working at the repair shop, so she synced her notes to her phone and we aren’t down any files.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/img_4388-scaled.jpg" alt="*On the way to the repair place, we came across this arch. Xi Jinping came to visit a couple days ago — he’s the first Chinese leader to visit Nepal since 1996. We were probably only a couple miles away from him.

I had shrugged this off after little pursuit, but now I think I shouldn’t have. While unable to boot the main system, I was still able to boot into the backup/recovery utility. From here I did a full backup to a flash drive and reinstalled the operating system. I took the opportunity to install something other than what I had before, though, so I can proudly say that the only smidgen of Google code I’m running is sandboxed and unprivileged; everything else is open source!</p><p>Anyway, because of the weird encryption issue, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to actually access that backup. I haven’t put much effort in yet, but there’s a chance I lost everything. And by “everything” I really just mean mostly pictures. And by “pictures” I really just mean mostly memes. So not a big loss.</p><h2>Trekking to Nagi Gompa</h2><p>From our front door, we took an 11-mile (horizontally measured) hike halfway up the nearest foothill (2300 ft. elevation gain) to a Buddhist nunnery, run by Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, that we can see from our rooftop. It was exhausting, the views were great, the clean air was a nice break, and here are a bunch of pictures:</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/18d595b6-131e-43bc-bfda-91c1087ac38c.jpg" alt="A super Nepali scene: flag, motorcycle, Dashain swing. A temple and bodhi tree (the same species as the tree the Buddha gained enlightenment under) are just out of frame.

Sameer led the trip; he’s an upperclassman from India who happens to be Kendrea’s peer advisor. We got to know Tia in swing club, choir, and class; she already professionally translates between Hindi and English, and she’s here to learn to translate Tibetan and Sanskrit. Yuki is another OSU study abroad student, and we’ve really enjoyed getting to know her well here. Between the five of us, we used seven languages over the course of the trek: English, Hindi, Nepali, French, Japanese, Tibetan, and German.

Or maybe they pay kids to climb the trees.” Naturally, we shortly came across a Tibetan family trying to hang up some prayer flags. They had tied a rock to the end and were trying to throw it. Then (as our Tibetan-speaking group members told us), they recruited a child to climb the tree, offering to pay him. We later joked about how I speak and whatever I say comes to be.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/img_4266-e1571859944845-768x1024-1.jpg" alt="*The aforementioned Tibetan family hanging up prayer flags*" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4266-e1571859944845-768x1024-1-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4266-e1571859944845-768x1024-1-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4266-e1571859944845-768x1024-1-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4266-e1571859944845-768x1024-1-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Near the top, we came across a crystal clear stream that crossed the path.

For Khenpo class (the one taught in the traditional Tibetan monastic style), we need to memorize 15 verses, 10 of which (at random) we will need to recite for the test. To aid in the memorization process, I made a small terminal program in under 100 lines of C. After showing it to classmate, they wanted to use it! Knowing that a terminal-run program is hardly the most intuitive UI paradigm for this crowd, we set out to re-make it as a website. Another night or two later and the teacher forwarded the link to the class. <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~kulpga/verses/">Here it is</a>, if you’re curious. Judging by the thankful emails, texts, and even in-person comments we’ve received, all before classes have even started up again, it seems that the memorization tool has been helpful!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/img_4409.png" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4409-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4409-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4409-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/34/responsive/img_4409-lg.webp 1024w"></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/nepal/index.html">nepal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/dog-dog-dog-dog/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Dog dog dog dog</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/kancane-kancane-little-by-little/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Kancane kancane (little by little)</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/gabriel-and-kendrea/index.html" class="invert" title="Gabriel and Kendrea">Gabriel and Kendrea</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/first-week-of-work/index.html" class="invert">First week of work!</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-02T04:13">September 2, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
