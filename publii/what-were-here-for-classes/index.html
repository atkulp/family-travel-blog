Many have been devout Buddhists for years. Many new students have never written academic papers. Some have undergraduate degrees in Buddhist Studies and are here to get graduate degrees. Some are monks and nuns who memorize religious texts on a regular basis. Some older people have left careers in the West to deepen their religious practice. The vast majority speak English as a second language. I’m amazed that it works to cram us all in the same classroom and give us the same assignments.</p><h2>Khenpo Class</h2><p>We have Khenpo class (a.k.a. Textual Studies 101, taught by a highly educated Tibetan monk) every day for 1.5 hours, plus a weekly 1-hour review class with the translator. (Side note: we enjoy hearing the translator speak Tibetan with Khenpo with her strong Russian accent.) We study one book — Shantideva’s <em>Bodhisattvacharyavatara</em> — line by line. When we leave after four months of study, we will only be halfway through the book! Along the way, we draw on Tibetan Buddhist commentaries to learn theories, terms, lists, and more.</p><p>“Bodhisattvacharyavatara” translates to “The Way of the Bodhisattva”. A bodhisattva is a being who generates <em>bodhicitta</em>, the wish to attain enlightenment for the sake of liberating all sentient beings from the painful cycle of rebirth. The goal in the Mahayana tradition, the largest branch of Buddhism, is to become an enlightened bodhisattva. Shantideva wrote this foundational text in the eighth century to guide ordinary beings on the bodhisattva path. Speaking of the bodhisattva path, here’s a chart I made that gives a good idea of the depth we’re going into:</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/img_4162.jpg" alt="I worked hard to piece this together from offhand comments spread out over several days." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4162-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4162-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4162-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4162-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>RYI’s Textual Studies courses are taught in the traditional format, in which monastics teach monastics. Therefore, even though Khenpo and the translator carefully accommodate the non-Buddhists in the class (nobody’s trying to convert us, we promise!), the structure of the course assumes a Buddhist audience. Consequently, we pray at the beginning and end of the class, and we’re required to memorize (I think) 30 verses of the text. Here’s a representative verse:</p><pre><code>Should bodhicitta come to birth Revered by all the world, by gods and humankind.</code></pre><p>And here’s the dedication prayer we say in Tibetan at the end of the class:</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/img_4161-scaled.jpg" alt="Khenpo leads the chanting in a low, rhythmic voice." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4161-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4161-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4161-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4161-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h2>Nepali Language</h2><p>RYI takes its language classes seriously! We hear that Colloquial Tibetan, Classical Tibetan, and Sanskrit classes are much more difficult than Nepali, but we’re still working hard. We have an hour of “Master Class” with our lovely professor three times a week, an hour of one-on-one practice with native speakers twice a week, and an hour of “Boost Class” with four students and two native speakers once a week. That’s a total of six hours of language class every week. Since the class sizes are so small, we’re constantly put on the spot to speak individually. With all the classes, homework, daily life with a Nepali host family, and interactions with Nepali people around town, we’re learning pretty quickly.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/img_4153-scaled.jpg" alt="A representative homework assignment. My handwriting is a bit messy because I wrote on my lap." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4153-scaled-xs.webp 300w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4153-scaled-sm.webp 480w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4153-scaled-md.webp 768w, file:///F:/Temp/Publii/previews/media/posts/24/responsive/img_4153-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><h3>Fun Facts</h3><ul><li>“Kendrea” means “central” in Nepali and Hindi! Apparently it has positive connotations of mental concentration.</li><li>You can refer to others in either an honorific or informal way. A husband uses the informal pronoun for his wife. But… a wife must use the honorific pronoun for her husband. I can understand using informal both ways (because spouses know each other well) or honorific both ways (because spouses should respect each other), but the inequality is pretty gross.</li><li>Dear Aunts Rennie, Ileana, Maria, and Ariadne: you are sisters of Gabriel’s father, so he can refer to each of you as “phoopoo” 😉</li></ul><h2>Anthropology</h2><p>We regret to announce that Father Greg, our Buddhist Studies 205 professor, has been temporarily deported. The Nepali government bureaucracy makes it really difficult to maintain your visa! The class is supposed to take place for 1.5 hours twice a week, but we’ve only had three or four classes so far. We’ll write about it when we have more to say!</p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>Finally, I’m taking Fundamentals of Buddhist Philosophy (a.k.a. Buddhist Studies 203) without Gabriel. In this class, we study <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/no-self-or-true-self/">emptiness</a>. We read and discuss one academic paper and one <em>sutra </em>(story of the Buddha’s teachings) every week. This material is all pretty new to me and interesting!</p><p>I switched out of the prerequisite class, so I’m having a bit of a hard time keeping track of all the terms that our professor, a Frenchwoman with an impressive American accent, tosses around. Besides, because this is a 200-level class, my experience with academic writing isn’t unusual! I’m not too concerned, though. I’ll just study a little harder and try to listen more than speak.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/tags/nepal/index.html">nepal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/orthodox-church-in-japan-pt-2/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Orthodox Church in Japan – Pt. 2</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/manga-manga/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Manga – まんが</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/authors/gabriel-and-kendrea/index.html" class="invert" title="Gabriel and Kendrea">Gabriel and Kendrea</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/were-alive/index.html" class="invert">We’re alive</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-12T23:52">September 12, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="file:///F:\Temp\Publii\previews/homestay-here-to-stay/index.html" class="invert">Homestay: Here to Stay</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-29T09:44">August 29, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
