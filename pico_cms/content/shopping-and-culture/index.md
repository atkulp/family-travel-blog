Today was a pretty slow day. After breakfast, we meet with the medical officers to go over anything they need to know for our stay. Of course, everything should be in our record, but data doesn’t necessarily seem to follow us as it should. At least it was painless enough.After that, we took a bus to a shopping area. This was important to get a feel for what’s available here and determine how hard it’s going to be to manage diet. It turns out, it probably some be very difficult. Selection of food was great and prices were reasonable. From peanut butter to burritos, spices to snacks, deodorant to soap, we’ll be able to get what we need.

After our shopping trip, we went to a cultural village. This is setup like a traditional Swazi village from over 100 years ago. The village is actually the domain of one guy, along with his mother, his wives, his children, and dogs and cattle. Each hut is a bedroom, a brewing room, or other gathering room. A friendly guide showed us around and gave us the details.

After the tour, we got to see a traditional dance as would have been performed by the single men and women. Their singing was amazing and the dancing quite lively. Not much relation to ballroom dance…

After that was done, we got back in our van. Right before getting in though, we saw a monkey nearby. It wasn’t the first, but it was the closest.

Back on campus, it&#8217;s rest and supper. Tomorrow starts the real work with our one-week training. No matter how challenging it is though, we can&#8217;t really complain. Regular Peace Corps pre-service training (PST) is three months!
