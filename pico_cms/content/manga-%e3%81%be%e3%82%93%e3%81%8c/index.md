Those of my family and friends that know me well know that I&#8217;ve always been an avid reader. Devouring all of the fantasy and sci-fi novels I could get my hands on from the age of ten, I&#8217;ve built up quite a hefty collection of books that I now have to lug along wherever I move. Not content with the cold touch of an e-book, I&#8217;ve always preferred to read physical copies of all of my favorite books. I&#8217;ve read my first copy of Eragon, my all time favorite book, so many times I had to buy a second copy because the first is literally falling apart.

Noticeably absent from my voluminous collection, however, is even a single volume of manga. For those who are as yet unaware, manga is a Japanese style of graphic novel. Manga is a term that covers all ranges of fiction genres, and I&#8217;m sure some non fiction as well. I discovered manga in middle school while working as a library assistant, and I&#8217;ve loved the medium ever since.

Like many graphic novels, a single series of manga can span anywhere from 2 volumes to 100. This is in part because manga are also serialized, meaning one chapter is released regularly and compiled into a volume later. The longest running manga will typically run around 300 chapters, though there are those that have topped 1000. In order to have the complete series of a manga, one would need to buy all the volumes, or all of the copies of the serialized version.

This is where tragedy strikes. In the United States, not only are manga difficult to find in English, let alone Japanese, but they&#8217;re also rather expensive. $4-8 a volume doesn&#8217;t sound like much until you need to buy 27 of them! When you can buy normal print books for $20 ish dollars new, why would you buy a used set of manga for more than $100? As such, I&#8217;ve only ever owned 5 or 10 volumes of manga, and never a complete series.

Until now.

Incidentally, in Japan, manga are very common and used goods are rather cheap. Today, Damian and I decided to go by a used book store on a whim after dinner, just to see what was on offer. They were having an absolutely ridiculous sale, where all manga currently priced at ¥50 ($0.50) were marked down to ¥10. Yes, that&#8217;s right. Roughly equivalent to $0.10 per volume. %0.025 of the price of a single used volume in English in the States.

I went a bit nuts.

I did buy a few more normally priced volumes, around ¥100, but this sale was targeted directly at me, and I embraced it. In total I bought **88 volumes** of manga. The cost of all 88 volumes came out to be about $30, or ¥3000. 88 volumes for $30. In the States, at the used price of $4 per volume, I would have spent $352.

I&#8217;m not sure how else to describe my current state of mind other than elated, but a picture is worth a thousand words, so I&#8217;ll wrap this up with one. Now I just need to figure out how to get all of these home!
