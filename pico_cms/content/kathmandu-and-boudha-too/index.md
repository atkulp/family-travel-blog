The last three days have been a whirlwind!

We are now proud residents of Boudhanath (&#8220;BOH-dah-nahth&#8221;), called Boudha (&#8220;BOH-dah&#8221;) for short. We&#8217;d imagined it as a separate town, but it&#8217;s really just a district of Kathmandu, just as bustling as the rest of the city. Also, we mistakenly thought it would be like a culturally distinct Tibet-town. Sure, you see more Buddhist monks and Tibetan signs here than elsewhere, but it still blends into the Hindu Nepali rest of the city. According to Dr. Barstow, it&#8217;s difficult to distinguish between the two cultures at all — Kathmandu has been a center of cultural exchange between India and Tibet for millennia.

Lemme try to paint a picture here. Narrow streets twist and turn around haphazardly constructed buildings. To navigate, you step over mud puddles, under low-hanging cables, and through gates. You&#8217;ll see some construction zones, because the 2015 earthquake left lasting damage. It&#8217;s monsoon season, which means that it rains torrentially for a few hours each day, so you&#8217;ll want to duck under concrete shop awnings for cover. Watch out for taxis, cars, and especially motorcycles! They&#8217;ll speed around blind corners, honking to tell you to get out of the way. You&#8217;re bound to bump into some fellow pedestrians, but they&#8217;re used to it; no need to say &#8220;excuse me&#8221;. Several stories of tiny shops, each packed with goods, line the road. Most seem to specialize in one thing: fruit, soap, space heaters, you name it. My favorites so far are tailor shops — they&#8217;ll sew you whatever you like from the beautiful rainbows of fabric stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Boudha is centered around its famous stupa, one of the largest in the world. To show respect, always walk clockwise around it. In the touristy area around the stupa, you&#8217;ll see Buddhist statues, Buddhist prayer beads, and souvenir T-shirts.

We hope to write specialized blog posts soon about food, animals, Rangjung Yeshe, local religion, and such. I&#8217;d like to remember the first things we did here, though, so here&#8217;s a quick chronological rundown of our first few days.

## Day 1

We ate breakfast at Shechen Guest House with the group (plus a lovely Indian-Australian family we made friends with at the airport), then headed out right away to see Boudha for the first time. We spent an hour or two crowded into a closet-sized enclosure of ATM machines and walking back and forth between a photocopy shop and a Ncell (Nepali cell service) shop to get SIM cards. To get there, we had to cross the main road for the first time — quite the exciting experience when there are practically no traffic laws! Then, we visited the Western-style coffee shop and went to my now-favorite restaurant for lunch. In the afternoon, we spent a few hours at someone&#8217;s home. Megan, a student who participated in this same program last year, is house-sitting there and taking care of the kitten, Rigpa. Dr. Barstow left so that Megan could tell us dirty secrets! (Spoiler: there are no dirty secrets unless you participate in the nightlife in the backpacker ghetto area of Kathmandu. Not our scene.) Finally, Megan, Mesa, Yuki, Gabriel, and I ate dinner at a Spanish restaurant with unimpressive food but an impressive view.

## Day 2

Over breakfast at the guest house, Dr. Barstow proposed a relaxed itinerary for the day, but it quickly became apparent that his definition of &#8220;relaxed&#8221; is different from ours. We started by visiting our new school, Rangjung Yeshe. Unlike other monasteries tucked away into small spaces, this one has quite the large compound! We met one of Dr. Barstow&#8217;s close professor friends, the wonderfully caring student services coordinator (who Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche calls the &#8220;shedrub mama&#8221;), some monks, and even an administrator from Corvallis. We went along with Dr. Barstow to the quarters of a senior monk to have him fill a couple Tibetan statues with religious items.

Next, we kept walking&#8230;

and walking&#8230;

until we reached a more rural area.

We had some well-deserved sodas from a corner store at the top.

Worn out, we took taxis back to Boudha, recovered with a cold matcha latte and blended mocha at the Western coffee shop, rested at the hotel, went out to dinner, and picked up a few necessities (yay hand soap!) at one of the larger corner stores.

## Day 3

Running out of time, so I&#8217;ll keep this short! We went on our biggest expedition yesterday. We took a long taxi ride across Kathmandu to Swayambhu, one of the holiest sites in Newar Buddhism. Boudha felt pretty urban, but the larger streets and crowds in the middle of Kathmandu set it apart. Dodging street dogs, adorable monkeys, and less-adorable pushy street vendors, we walked up many flights of stairs, observing all kinds of ancient art along the way. The top of the temple has so much history and significance that I feel terrible devoting so few words to it, but you can read more [here][1].

On our way back home, we stopped in Thamel, the backpacker ghetto area of town that Dr. Barstow can&#8217;t stand because of its extreme orientation toward foreigners. However, it has the best bookstores and restaurants, so we browsed his favorite bookstore in the world — I bought two books — and ate lunch at a large Western-style pizzeria.

Back in Boudha, we went to Fr. Greg&#8217;s home. He&#8217;s a Jesuit Catholic priest, longtime resident of Nepal, extremely knowledgeable anthropologist, American, and our academic advisor. I think he&#8217;s the first person we&#8217;ve visited who has a servant. This particular servant, Raju, is a friendly dude and an incredible cook! Over tea, Fr. Greg told us all about the sprawling Nepali bureaucracy. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s legal to publicly criticize the government, so I&#8217;ll stop there&#8230;

On the way home from dinner, Jesus, Gabriel, and I came across a large group of monks dancing in the dark at the Shechen monastery. It was mesmerizing. We sat and watched for a while.

Time for breakfast! Be back soon.
