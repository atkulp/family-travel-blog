Today is our last full day in Oregon! Lilly has a training in Portland followed by a lunch, we&#8217;ll overnight at a friend&#8217;s house, and then leave tomorrow morning at 11:45. We said goodbye to my parents on Wednesday and now it&#8217;s our turn!

Thank you to everyone that helped us clear our apartment! Lilly and I have decided that 3rd floor apartments are not so much fun to move out of. Things were rushed, but we love you all and couldn&#8217;t have done it without your help!

Finally, for those that were aware: Lilly&#8217;s surgery on Wednesday went ok and she&#8217;s been healing up well. She discovered she had a retinal tear in her left eye on Tuesday, they operated on Wednesday to spotweld the retina in place, and then she got to spend Thursday feeling like she&#8217;d been punched really hard in the face. Not the best timing in terms of us leaving the country, but at least her retina won&#8217;t detach in Japan!

We&#8217;re excited to be starting this journey and look forward to sharing lots of pictures and stories with everyone!
