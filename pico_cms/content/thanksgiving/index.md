Well, it&#8217;s a bit late. Sorry about that! We had tons of prep beforehand and cleanup after!

First off, Thanksgiving is not celebrated in Japan, surprise! Though some American holidays have been adopted a little, Thanksgiving is definitely not one of them. So to celebrate it, we invited the Alt&#8217;s and a few of the Japanese people that hang out with the Alt&#8217;s.

In total, we had 7 people come over (we invited more but several people backed out day of&#8230;). We structured the meal part as a potluck, we provided the turkey, mashed potatoes, and pies, and asked everyone else to bring sides and drinks. People brought gyōza, mac and cheese, camel corn, and a variety of other favorites.

While we were waiting for people to arrive, we had Lilly&#8217;s switch set up for people to play Mario kart, which people seemed to enjoy. We also just hung out and talked a bunch. No football though! We don&#8217;t even own a TV!

## Turkey

We did end up finding turkey at Costco in Sendai, so I got to defrost, prepare, cook, and serve a turkey for the first time. It was an interesting process, especially because the bird only just barely fit both in our fridge and later in our oven. Everyone seemed to enjoy it so it was worth it!

## Desserts

Lilly wanted to make two desserts: apple cobbler and pumpkin pie. Cobbler is pretty easy and she&#8217;s made some very yummy cobbler several times before. As expected, the cobbler was delicious!

The more challenging dessert was the pumpkin pie. Usually pumpkin pie isn&#8217;t too challenging as long as you can make a good crust, but we faced a different challenge here: no pumpkins&#8230;.

Weeelllll, I guess that&#8217;s not quite fair to say. Japan has, &#8220;pumpkins&#8221; in that they have a squash they call pumpkin, but it&#8217;s not.

The problem with Japanese pumpkin is that it simultaneously has less sugar and water but more starch than what we&#8217;re used to in the States. This means that pretty much no recipe will work as the ratios are all wrong. We had to try several different variations of different recipes before we finally found something that works.

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll mean much to people to give a complete recipe, but the biggest changes we made were as follows: add more sugar, boil the squash like mashed potatoes to get as much liquid as possible, and food process it a decent bit to smooth everything out.

## Everything Else

The night went very well! People had fun, the food was all good, we enjoyed the company &#8211; overall a good night! The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were well received as American classics, and since most of the Alt&#8217;s don&#8217;t cook so they&#8217;ve missed out!
