The last two weeks of December ended up being our first leave from Peace Corps. From the start, we wanted to visit Gabriel and Kendrea in Nepal, and Damian and Lilly in Japan. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to get much leave in the first few months, plus the cost was horrendous, so we didn&#8217;t end up going to Nepal. Instead, we went to Japan with a bonus: Gabriel and Kendrea finished their study abroad and were going through Japan on their way home to Oregon! We were there for two weeks and stayed at Damian and Lilly&#8217;s apartment in Sanuma (in Tome).

We took a shuttle bus to Johannesburg so we could fly out of O.R. Tambo International Airport, then had a layover in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We even made a quick stop in Seoul, Korea for reasons I still don&#8217;t understand, but necessitated everyone leaving, going through security screening again, then re-boarding. Definitely wasn&#8217;t some emergency thing since we did it both ways.

We landed in Narita and took a train to a guesthouse for the night. It was a great little place very close to a historic street. In the morning, we walked down the street, and got fire-roasted yams and chestnuts from different street vendors. We talked to Karen&#8217;s brother Dan and he highly recommended that we go to a close by temple complex, so we headed over there. It was quite beautiful and I&#8217;m glad we could go.

Getting back to the guesthouse, we met a guy named Ignacio who was from Belgium and was finishing up a year-long bike ride around the world! We chatted for a bit and got insanely jealous. He&#8217;s been to so many places and gotten to see so much. Places I wouldn&#8217;t normally think of as safe enough to visit, let alone to cycle through! You can read more about him on [his blog][1].

Damian and Lilly met up with us in Tokyo and we spent two nights there. Tokyo is a great city! So many things to see. We took the train wherever we went (public transit can be so liberating!) and went to several areas. We also spent a number of hours at the [Edo Museum][2]. So many great exhibits showcasing the Edo period. I love miniature models/dioramas, and this place had so many!

We also went to the St. Nicholas cathedral (ok, so it&#8217;s actually called [Holy Resurrection Cathedral][3]) and were able to attend liturgy. It was so wonderful since there&#8217;s no Orthodox church in Eswatini. I couldn&#8217;t understand it, but I was able to follow along in an English-language book and sing along phonetically. Saint Nicholas and the cathedral are actually pretty big deals in Tokyo. Since there are so few Christians, the bells are a bit unusual and well-known. The Edo Museum even had a recording of the bells to accompany their model!

We went up to Damian and Lilly&#8217;s place and got settled in. The next day, we drove to Sendai Station (not as far as Tokyo) to pickup Gabriel and Kendrea. Now our group was the full six. It was such a wonderful feeling being around all of them after so long! That&#8217;s definitely the hardest part of being so far away.

During the visit, we played games, talked, and saw various sites in the region. We were consistently amazed with the number of vending machines out and about! Pretty much every block, you&#8217;d see one, two, six different machines. Mostly beverages, but it was very cool to see machines where the cans of hot drinks were actually hot! Coffee, cocoa, corn soup, all ready to go. It&#8217;s hard to imagine how they get enough business.

![Hot? Cold? They got you covered!](assets/2020/01/IMG_20191229_160913.jpg)

In case you couldn&#8217;t get enough from the machines, there were convenience stores (*kombini*s) every few blocks. One chain called Lawson, and then quite a few 7-11&#8217;s. Food was readily available and reasonably priced. The only real issues were reading the labels, and my stupid celiac gut. It turns out that the Japanese *really* love their soy sauce. No, I mean *really*. It was hard to find almost anything prepared that was safe. Thankfully, Lilly was able to check the ingredient lists, and I was also able to use my phone to translate. It was definitely disappointing to be restricted like that. We were fine buying our own supplies and cooking back at the apartment though.

During our stay we saw a number of different temples. They&#8217;re quite beautiful. We also saw a windmill! It was a gift from the Dutch and installed at Naganuma Futopia Park. They also had a *very* long slide with rollers for the surface. It was probably for kids, but it didn&#8217;t stop all of us from having great fun on it too!

Before we left, we saw the [Toyoma Education Museum][4] in Tome which portrays a typical Japanese elementary school in the late 1800&#8217;s with lots of interesting exhibits in former classrooms. The next morning, on our way to the station, we visited the town of Ishinomaki. This was a town very heavily hit during the tsunami a few years ago, losing many children and other people in the flooding. It was sad to see how much recovery there still was left, though it was clear there was also incredible progress.

Our last stop was in the touristy town of Matsushima. It was a beautiful place with ocean views and a gorgeous park. Due to the features of their bay, they were somewhat protected during the tsunami and sustained less damage.

With some difficulty, we said our good-byes at the station. It&#8217;s never easy. Kendrea was to have an internship interview the next morning, and she and Gabriel would be getting ready for their own departure back to the US. We took the [Shinkansen][5] (bullet train) to Tokyo. It went as fast as 140mph! Definitely a great way to travel, though the price was outrageous&#8230;

Now back home in Eswatini, safe and sound (and Gabriel/Kendrea also home, for real), it&#8217;s time to settle back in and get back to work. I&#8217;m so glad we were able to make the trip, but it was a difficult departure. We already can&#8217;t wait to see them all again!
