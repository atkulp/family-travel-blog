One more week left of January. Nothing exciting since our return. We did get to go on a hike with some other volunteers to the top of Sibebe Rock, also called Execution Rock. It looks like a hill, but is actually the largest rock in the world (depending on who you ask&#8230;). It was some beautiful landscape with some trails through fields, grazing cattle, and even a lone horse!

We left way too early in the morning after waking up around 5am. I am not a morning person, so this was not an easy feat! We took a taxi to a starting point and just started walking the nearest path, hoping that it was the right away! We ended up walking through a homestead where we were given friendly help and they removed a section of their fence so we could walk through!

Part of the walk was along a rough road that was crazy narrow and steep in parts. I can&#8217;t imagine having to drive it! At one point, we saw some grass bundled together to be used on a thatch roof. It was pretty cool just seeing them lying there drying out. We also walked past a cave/alcove where a horse was hanging out. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t have my camera ready in time to get a shot of him still in there.

The hike ended up being several hours and was pretty tiring overall. Having started earlier, it wasn&#8217;t too hot until toward the end. I don&#8217;t think we could have done it much later!

We also walked past people working in their fields of corn and other crops. The area is on the outer edges of Mbabane so much more rural than we see day-to-day. It was so nice getting away for a few hours.

That&#8217;s really the only cool thing we&#8217;ve done this month, but hopefully there will be more! The hot season is apparently going to be cooling off in the near future which will make it easier to enjoy the outdoors, at least until it gets cold! We still have several game preserves to go to that we can&#8217;t miss!

I&#8217;m grateful that we have a great group of fellow volunteers who enjoy doing fun things! Trying to find our way around can be daunting, so it&#8217;s nice to be able to go with volunteers who have knowledge of a place or better understanding of how to go places. Since we can&#8217;t drive (Peace Corps Eswatini rule), we generally know the area where we live. Having a larger group makes these fun adventures possible!
