Greetings from 1:00 in the morning, somewhere over southeast Asia!

Time to catch you up on our final three weeks in Nepal.

We went on lots of little errands to prepare to leave. We enjoyed finding new parts of town. Gabriel really likes the traditional architecture, so here&#8217;s a representative door.

We don&#8217;t usually drink coffee, but we enjoyed studying at the Western-style coffee shop and expanding our coffee horizons. We sometimes even got the coveted stupa-view seats by the windows.

It turns out that Nepal has a holiday for eating grapefruit, so instead of our usual one-on-one language partner class, all the Nepali language partners cooked up a grapefruit dish for all of the students! It was a truly bizarre concoction, with grapefruit, milk (we had a special milk-free version), peanuts, chillies, mustard oil, sugar, sesame seeds, spices, and who knows what all else. We sat around in a circle on the stage at the monastery cafe to eat it.

Our host family had some shelves installed, so of course they called up the shelf bike dude.

We sang in the Boudha Community Chorale Christmas concert! It turned out to be quite the fancy affair. It took place at the monastery cafe, so we enjoyed a feast of fusion food afterward. It didn&#8217;t start out very auspiciously from our perspective&#8211;we took an accidental midday nap that made us late and then two people had to help get Gabriel&#8217;s tie on&#8211;but the singing part went well! The Boudha Community Chorale (mostly foreigners) hosted the concert; the British Model College Choir (all Nepali students) and the Kathmandu String Ensemble (all Nepali adults) also performed. The musical quality wasn&#8217;t up to the standards we&#8217;re used to in Corvallis, but it was still a pretty special experience to sing the Hallelujah Chorus at the top of our lungs with a large, diverse musical ensemble at a beautifully lit Buddhist outdoor cafe in Kathmandu.

Swing club wrapped up very well! Seven people, including us, participated in the final lesson. We taught our most advanced students tandem Charleston while Yuki gave beginner lessons to some newer folks. We danced, sang, and laughed to a playlist of holiday swing music.

We finished finals!! We worked really hard, and we think it paid off (no real-time grading like we&#8217;re used to back home, so we&#8217;ll need to wait for final grades to come in). I began this semester assuming that I could use my pre-existing philosophy essay skills, but I finally accepted that this school requires a different frame of mind. For my final paper, instead of bringing in my own science-y perspective like I would for philosophy papers at OSU, I tried sticking very closely to traditional Tibetan sources (translated to English, of course). I enjoyed stretching myself in this way, and I think it&#8217;s more in line with what the instructors intended. Don&#8217;t think that we had too much fun, though. They were still finals. Much stress.

The weather has been warm and sunny. Here&#8217;s Yuki demonstrating that one can comfortably snuggle with dogs outside.

Our last few days in Nepal were pretty pleasant, too. The Himalayas came out to greet us on a clear day. We delivered thank-you notes, recycled lots of class papers, did last-minute shopping around the stupa, had a serendipitous dinner with our friend Tia, and even visited Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche. We listened as he had conversations with other visitors in Tibetan and Nepali. We only spoke with him briefly, but it was lovely to bask in his kind glow.

See you in Japan!
