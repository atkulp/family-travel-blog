*Written on December 1. We&#8217;ve had some technical difficulties. *

We just wrapped up a 12-day break from school to allow students to attend Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche’s seminar. Wow, what an amazing set of activities we had planned for the break! We were going to attend some of the seminar, participate in a tea ceremony at a Taiwanese restaurant by the stupa, go on a three-day getaway to a Himalayan village, attend a town hall for American citizens at the ambassador’s house, get all of our errands done…

…yeah, actually we got sick and stayed inside all day, except for brief excursions to the pharmacy to get decongestant and pain pills. Sigh. At least we had time to be productive (and not just in terms of mucus quantity).

We have a little news, though.

We’re back in choir! We’d quit because rehearsals were at an inconvenient time for us. Last Sunday, we taught swing class as usual, and both choir directors came. After class, they pulled us aside and basically said “hey, uh, we had a rough rehearsal last week and we could really use your voices”. We couldn’t say no to that—we can manage to attend just a couple inconveniently timed rehearsals. So, later that week, we bundled up, showed up to the dress rehearsal at the lovely monastery-run outdoor cafe where we usually eat lunch, grabbed some music binders, and sight-read our way through. It felt great to sing in a group again—plus, we got to skip the messy learning process!

We had a lovely Thanksgiving dinner with a couple dozen other Americans at Fr. Greg’s house. We’d planned to cook a green bean casserole (heavily accommodated to fit the ingredients available here), but then we noticed that the recipe said to bake the casserole. We have no oven. Okay, green bean stir-fry it was! To our pleasant surprise, almost every dish was vegan, so we feasted well. There were even deep-fried Oreos. We met some new people and had some great conversations.

Also, we managed to spend Saturday night in the nearby Himalayan village of Nagarkot! More on that later.
