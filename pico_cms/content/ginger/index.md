Some people may know that Japan, and Asian countries in general, like their ginger. It&#8217;s used frequently in many different dishes and is popular in candy and drinks. Ginger also plays a particularly large role in sushi, where the reddish picked slices are eaten with pretty much any form of rice and fish.

Since ginger is so popular, and since I rather enjoy eating ginger, we thought it might be fun to try to make some of our own pickled ginger. The process isn&#8217;t that hard and makes some pretty yummy ginger!

The first step is peeling the ginger root. The skin is tough and fibery. Also, we don&#8217;t have a potato peeler or anything, so I had to use our knife to cut the skin off. Overall, this was the most time consuming and difficult step (it&#8217;s really not a hard process).

The next step is to cut the ginger into thin slices. There&#8217;s nothing precise about this step, we just want small pieces to make it easier to eat with stuff later. Our mandolin doesn&#8217;t have any settings for thickness, so our slices are thicker than you&#8217;d usually find at a restaurant.

Next we need to put the slices in a jar and prepare our pickling juice. Now I should mention that we&#8217;re not *really* pickling the ginger in the normal way. We&#8217;re going to do what&#8217;s called a quick pickle. The brine/juice is a mix of vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and spices such as anise if that&#8217;s your jam. We boiled the mixture with ginger sprouts, but they didn&#8217;t really give much flavor.

Once the mixture has been brought to a boil and left to simmer for a few min, the juice/brine is poured over the ginger and allowed to cook for a few min before sealing it and putting it in the fridge. Since this isn&#8217;t a real pickle, we don&#8217;t have to worry about gas build up in the jar &#8211; the container can be sealed and the pickle will brine for a few days at minimum.

For those that don&#8217;t know, raw ginger is quite strong and fibery. The vinegar and sugar will help sweeten and subdue the strong ginger flavor as well as break down the fibers a bit. That said, it&#8217;s still very gingery and has lots of fibers, just not as bad as raw.

In the end, the ginger didn&#8217;t turn quite as red as I was expecting, but apparently that&#8217;s due to the age of the ginger, younger = more pink. Though 2 days is the minimum for good ginger this way, ours sat for 2 weeks and is much better for it! The flavor is very good, still stronger than most restaurant grade stuff, but I prefer strong ginger.

Random ginger facts from the internet, pickled ginger has slight anti-microbial properties which may help in the consumption of raw food (fish mostly). Also, the vibrant pink often seen in restaurant ginger is because they add food coloring!
