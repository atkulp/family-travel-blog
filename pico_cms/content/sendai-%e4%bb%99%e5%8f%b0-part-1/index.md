Sendai! We haven&#8217;t talked much about this city, but it&#8217;s definitely the center of Miyagi. Sendai has a population of a bit more than a million people. It&#8217;s where you go for anything more than the basics, especially if you&#8217;re like us and find it hard to find that little piece of home. Sendai is where the only Costco in Miyagi lives, along with multitudes of other shopping locations, and a variety of specially shops not found elsewhere. Good examples of this are yarn shops, which are only available in Sendai.

Our little trip to Sendai, a bit more than an hour from Tome if you&#8217;re flush enough to take the toll road, started with a visit to the cathedral, as it was a Sunday morning. After finishing church, we decided to go see if we could find lunch nearby, and stumbled into a series of shopping streets.

These avenues are basically like if an open air market grew up to be a shopping mall. There are entrances to the main streets periodically, and the streets are roofed with glass. Despite this it is very clear that you&#8217;re walking down a road between buildings, with those buildings frequently extending up past the glass canopy.

The shops filling the street vary from hole in the wall ramen places to high tier luxury brands like Rolex and Gucci. There were also konbini (コンビニ), Japanese convenience stores, about once a block. One of the more interesting places we stopped by was a cat Cafe. It wasn&#8217;t what we expected, but it was a memorable experience none the less. My advice to anyone interested in visiting cat cafes is to do your research ahead if time, and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll say about it for now.

We also had lunch at a magical kind of restaurant, yakiniku (焼肉)! Order plates of thinly sliced raw mean and cook it yourself for the freshest of restaurant experiences. Some of them even have all you can eat buffet setups. Definitely a satisfying experience.

After lunch we headed over to the Sendai museum of History, where we got to see some historical artifacts important to the area, along with many, many maps. Honestly the museum almost deserves it&#8217;s own post.

There were of course samurai artifacts, mainly related to Date Masamune, the much celebrated feudal Lord of Miyagi.

Seeing so many old artifacts and clothing from Edo era Japan really impressed upon us how small most Japanese people used to be. It was fun taking pictures with Damian for scale!

There was also a whole section of artifacts related to the voyage to Europe Date Masamune sent some of his samurai on. They sailed to Spain by way of Mexico in an attempt to open trade, with additional visits to the pope in Rome, but we&#8217;re unfortunately unsuccessful. Not long after Christianity was banned in Japan, so no further attempts were made.

There were also some related religious relics, as the voyage was guided by Spanish missionaries and Spain in the 1600s was very, very Catholic. They were very interesting to see!

The final leg of our trip was the Sendai Aquarium, but since this post is getting a bit long I&#8217;ll leave that for another post!
