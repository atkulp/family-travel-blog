It&#8217;s been awhile since our last post. Any activity that relies on the internet is a challenge. This evening I need to study Siswati so I decided to go ahead and roll the blogging and the studying together.&nbsp; For once the internet connection seems to be holding steady.

Spring has arrived and we no longer need to wear layers of pajamas under layers of blankets at night.

Night = kuhlwile (The &#8220;ku&#8221; sounds like &#8220;goo&#8221; and the &#8220;hl&#8221; is a cat hissing sound that you make by putting the tip of your tongue behind your teeth and letting air flow between your cheeks and tongue.)

Ulelenjani? = How did you sleep? Ngilele kahle = I slept well.

For the most part, the weather has been sunny and comfortable. Lilanga = sun (it also means day). We have had a few days that have gotten really hot (kuyashisa) followed by impressive thunderstorms (liyadvuma) and rain (imvula).

We get up early and make breakfast. I have been having porridge made from sorghum (emabele) with peaches (emampentjisi).&nbsp; Then we walk down the hill to work.&nbsp; A couple of industrious locals come by the office to sell boiled peanuts in the shell (ematongomane), boiled corn on the cob (umbile), and avocados (emakotapeni) around noon for everyone who forgot to pack a lunch. &#8220;Ema&#8221; is a prefix indicating multiple of something so when you buy just one avocado it&#8217;s just *li*kotapeni.

At work, we follow the guidance of our boss (mphatsi) so that we can better understand the needs of the citizens (nine bekunene) of Eswatini. We are staying very busy with the project. Ngimatasatasa = I am busy.

![Okay, well maybe not as busy as these ladies. They were both turbo-walking, one while breastfeeding and the other while balancing brooms on her head! Very impressive!](assets/2019/10/IMG_20191012_174403-1.jpg)

At the end of the day we either walk about two blocks to visit the mothers (bomake) who sell fruits and vegetables in the stalls along the street, go a little further to the shopping center for last minute dinner items, or just head back up the path to our apartment. 

![These aren&#8217;t actually vendors near where we work in the city, but the stalls are a similar setup.](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190921_130539.jpg)

By this point in the day, I&#8217;m usually really hungry (ngilambile) and tired (ngidziniwe). There aren&#8217;t as many convenience foods here so we cook (pheka) every day (onkhe malanga) and always have a lot of dishes to wash. We also have to wash the produce carefully so our delicate American stomachs don&#8217;t end up in knots.

Sometimes in the evenings I study (ngifundza) Siswati, but usually I just drink tea (nginatsa litiya) and read for awhile until I am sleepy (ngiyatela).

Note: the word kancane from the title is pronounced with the &#8220;c&#8221; as a click made by the tip of the tongue on the back of the front teeth. So it&#8217;s like gan-\*click\*-an-ay. The click is used is a lot of words, for example no (cha) and sorry (ncesi).
