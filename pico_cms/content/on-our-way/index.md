After sleeping for two hours, we boarded the shuttle from Corvallis to the airport, then took the 8am flight to Atlanta. Now we&#8217;re laying over waiting for the trip to Johannesburg. Finishing the final tasks of packing our luggage, packing up the house, and general house cleaning seemed like it would never be done! Then, actually walking out for the last time (after 10:00), the doors locked behind us, I think we all felt it more than we thought we would. Ten years in a house is a long time, especially when it&#8217;s your home from middle/high school up to marriage (as kids and as parents of those kids). It&#8217;s not just a house, of course, it&#8217;s a home.

It was tough as parents needing to focus on our own departure to the exclusion of helping the boys with theirs. One the one hand, it&#8217;s good that we all depart so close, but it feels like we parents should be there to see the kids off first. We know they&#8217;ll do great once they are there, but the lead-up can be stressful.

Now, we work on cramming a little more on SiSwati language learning. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be impressing anyone with our vocabulary, but we don&#8217;t want to be completely unprepared! The first two weeks consist of daily Peace Corps classes about the country, the people, the language, and hopefully our actual assignments! We&#8217;ve already done a number of hours of videos and assignments about the organization and what it means to be part of it. We aren&#8217;t too worried. We trust that between Peace Corps and God, we&#8217;ll be taken care of! One day at a time.
