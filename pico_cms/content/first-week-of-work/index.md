Hello again from Japan! Last week was my first week of work as an ALT at three elementary schools in Tome City. I visited my main school three times, and my secondary schools once each. This will be the normal schedule for me.

This first week was full mainly of introduction classes. I have the class period to introduce my students to me, to Oregon, and to my family.

I started most classes by talking and taking questions about Oregon. Kids were usually surprised that we have desert in Oregon, and they were excited to talk about it. Japan doesn&#8217;t have any areas that can be called a desert, so this is something they&#8217;ve never really seen before. They were also generally surprised that there are wolves living in Oregon, because they were eradicated in Japan a while ago.

When I talked about my family and told everyone I was married they were impressed I think! If I told them to guess my age before telling them I was married they were pretty close to the mark, but if it was after I got ten years added to my age! I think this is because it is extremely uncommon for Japanese people to get married before 27 or 28. They were also always excited to hear about my family pets, Sara and Griffin!

Every day at school both the students and teachers eat *kyushoku*, or school lunch. Everyone eats the same food, and it&#8217;s usually very good food. Children serve each other their lunch in the classroom, with those serving changing regularly. I eat either in the teacher&#8217;s room or with one of the students&#8217; classes.

Adjusting to teaching has been a little difficult so far. Some of the teachers I work with don&#8217;t know any English beyond what they teach, which can make commutation difficult. They&#8217;re also very busy, making lesson planning very touch and go. So far things have been going well though! I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the kids I work with grow as people and as English speakers.
