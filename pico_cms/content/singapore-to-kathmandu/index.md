So first, there&#8217;s the Singapore airport. Stunning. Beautiful. Clean. You may have seen pictures of it before, but the largest indoor waterfall is inside a giant indoor rainforest in a glass dome. There&#8217;s also a walk-in butterfly garden and a koi pond. It&#8217;s just crazy.

We had about 6½ hours between flights, so we (me, Kendrea, Mesa, Kalie, Dr. Barstow) decided to leave the airport! Immigration and customs was fairly quick, but there was definitely an authoritarian vibe&#8230;

We took a taxi to the famous [Gardens by the Bay][1] and saw the weird [Marina Bay Sands][2] towers. Entrance to the Gardens is free, but you need to pay to enter some portions. It was too much money to enter the indoor greenhouses, but we did decide to do the hanging bridge in the Supertree Grove.

After marveling at the cleanliness of the Gardens, we took the subway to [Raffles Hotel][3]. The whole subway experience was much closer to an airport tram than a US public transit vibe. We were shocked when we saw a single q-tip on the ground, since it was the only hint of litter. We ate some very good and cheap food at an underground food court, then headed up to Raffles.

We tried to go to the Long Bar to try a Singapore Sling (exclusive mixed drink), but the line was too long for how much layover we had left. Instead we went to a courtyard with a less-fancy bar and got some drinks there.

We walked a bit to find a taxi and returned to the airport. Everything went smoothly as we re-entered the airport, boarded the plane to Kathmandu, and left the ground one last time.

## Kathmandu

We landed at around 9pm local time and exited the plane straight to the tarmac. A bus came to pick us up and bring us to the terminal, where we filled out a form on a glitchy kiosk, paid the $125 visa fee, and went through customs (which was kind of a joke). It took us a while to all make it through the process, but when we finished, we got on a taxi and had the strangest transit experience yet. Kendrea made the mistake of using the bathroom in the airport.

When we all reconvened after customs, we got on a taxi and had the strangest transit experience yet.

Many of the roads here are dirt and not exactly flat. There are usually no lines on the road. You don&#8217;t need a license to drive. Most people don&#8217;t wear seatbelts, and some cars (like the taxi) have them inaccessible under the aftermarket seats. Over half of the vehicles are motorcycles. Many of the cars are manuals with small tires (so you feel the bumps more). There are dogs, people, and sometimes even goats and cows in the road. Instead of slowing down before going around a blind corner, people just honk to announce their presence. If someone is driving too slowly, they&#8217;ll get honked at when overtaken. It&#8217;s common to swerve into oncoming traffic to go around someone who&#8217;s slow, a sleeping dog, or a pothole.

Basically, the whole thing physically felt like a rollercoaster and emotionally was just a big game of trust. A taxi driver, of all people, should be pretty good at navigating the chaos, right?

We arrived at Shechen Guest House (where we&#8217;ll stay until we move in with our host families) after closing time, so we had to kind of holler at the gate for someone to come. We entered a courtyard and picked up our key, then went to our room.

We found two pretty normal-looking beds that turned out to not have normal mattresses. They&#8217;re basically mats rolled out on the bed frame, so they&#8217;re pretty firm. Comfy enough, but certainly not what we&#8217;re used to in the US. We took a cold shower and went to sleep.

(Sorry for the lack of Kathmandu pictures. It was dark and we were very tired. More pictures to come later!)
