Since all of last week was a holiday, there were lots of festivals all over the place for different things depending on the day. There were a bunch of fireworks festivals later in the week, but on Sunday afternoon was a dance festival.

We arrived at the festival mid afternoon and as we walked up, there was a very intense group of girls (middle school I think?) from one of the local schools performing in the streets. This style of dance involves moving forward quite far, so the festival was setup at a T intersection: the top part of the T was where two different groups would perform separately as they moved toward the middle, the bottom of the T was a large main stage where different groups would perform, and the intersection of the T was where all the food stalls were.

We grabbed a bit of food and watched a bunch of different performances, we were both super impressed with the flag waving. Each troup had 1-3 flag wavers at the back of the group and their flags were huge. I can&#8217;t imagine how much strength it must have taken to wave the flags like they were, but they were all ripped.

We arrived right at the end of all the performances, so we got to see the big finale where all the troupes performed together twice, and then afterwards all the flag bearers came out, they introduced all the groups, then did a performance with just the flags twice.

I&#8217;m not sure if Lilly will approve of me uploading these, but there was also a group all the way from Hokkaido (some from Sendai as well, this was apparently a well known event) who took things up a notch. At one point in their main performance, the men all stripped down to their loin clothes and finished the dance like that. Of course during the combined performance at the end, they excitedly repeated that aspect of their show for everyone to enjoy.
