We landed at Narita International Airport at 1:45pm our time, and were ushered through lots of volunteers to get our bags shipped to Tome and our persons to the hotel. We then had a 90 min bus ride to Shinjuku, Tokyo where we checked into our room. When all was said and done, it was about 5:30 and we decided to go get some ramen. We ran to a 7-11 to grab onigiri, and then went and had some yummy ramen at a nearby restaurant. The food was fast, cheap, and quite yummy! Finally, we headed back to the hotel and grabbed some mochi skewers with red bean paste on top 🍡.

We&#8217;re pretty tired, but we got to see some country-side as we bused in and we got to do just a little bit of exploring. We&#8217;re definitely ready for a good night&#8217;s sleep!
