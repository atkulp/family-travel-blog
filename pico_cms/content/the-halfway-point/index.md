It&#8217;s strange how the pace of life is notoriously slower here and yet for us it feels like there&#8217;s a mountain of work and never enough hours in the day. Some of that can be attributed to necessary daily rituals such as cooking, washing dishes, hanging laundry out on the line. There&#8217;s very little prepackaged convenience foods so meals require more food prep. We are so lucky that we live close to the central shopping area of Mbabane, but it still takes longer to walk to the stores and back than it would to do it by car (not to mention that we have to carry all of those groceries up the hill!). I don&#8217;t mind the chores though since they seem like a natural and essential part of the daily life. The more difficult part is the office work. There&#8217;s a constant level of frustration because the &#8220;right way&#8221; of doing things is often completely impractical here. You will have a time sensitive email that needs to be sent ASAP, but the internet is down (or the power is out). Last week we had a flash flood. I couldn&#8217;t cross the road to get to a meeting in the building right across the street because the road had turned into white water rapids! Funding is always on the verge of being pulled away from the project and the cut backs are crippling our efforts. There&#8217;s never enough hands to make the work light. Despite these challenges, our coworkers are excited about the direction of the project. It may not happen quickly, but progress is being made.

It&#8217;s also amazing how long six months can feel. I really can&#8217;t focus on the total time remaining because it seems unbearable to be away from family and friends for so long. But, one more day seems manageable. So, I am taking it one day at a time!
