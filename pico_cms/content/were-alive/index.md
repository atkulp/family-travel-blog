Just in case anyone was concerned that we haven&#8217;t posted for a little bit, we just wanted to assure everyone that we are alive! We haven&#8217;t made it to any festivals recently and we&#8217;re still trying to figure out some of the basics that didn&#8217;t come with our apartment (we finally got a real stove, still working on an oven, got internet sorted, etc.)

We do have a few larger posts in the works, but it&#8217;s taking some time to collect some good pictures and to make sure we have enough experience to actually write a good post.

As to our person stuff: we&#8217;re doing alright! My work is going well and I&#8217;ve not had any issues remoting to Oregon (other than that I&#8217;m not really a morning person and 5am is definitely the morning!). Lilly is getting into the groove of normal teaching stuff and today is visiting her first kindergarten. We&#8217;re both excited about the addition of a stove since it means that we can finally cook more than one thing at once!

We&#8217;re also planning some visits to other parts of Japan, so keep an eye on the blog in the next few weeks. Lilly has some 3 day weekends that we&#8217;re going to make good use of, possibly going to a ryokan (旅館) or traditional inn with tatami matted rooms and public baths in the Sendai area.

So we&#8217;ve got some plans for the next few weeks, we&#8217;re finally getting our apartment setup more, and we&#8217;re definitely still alive, we just haven&#8217;t done anything terribly interesting for a week or two (sorry).
