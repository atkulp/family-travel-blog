This week is all about setting up our new apartment and going to work. We arrived at our new place on Monday after our swearing-in. We went over in a truck along with our belongings, accompanied by a truck with items supplied by the Peace Corps which included:

*   Blanket
*   Sheets and pillowcases
*   Pots and pans
*   Flatware, cutlery, cups/bowls/plates
*   Large basin and buckets
*   Gas cooking stove

For us, everything was doubled since we each get a set, but instead of two stoves, they increased the two-burner to a three. The list is tailored to volunteers in rural areas so not everything applies as much to us. The large basin is for bathing (!) and the buckets for hauling water. We really lucked out with our place since we have a full kitchen that included cups/bowls/plates, and a regular bathroom with shower (no need for baths in a basin!). The gas cooking stove is to use if electricity goes out, which it does from time to time, even in the city.

Our place is simple, but very nice. The living room and bedroom are one room, with a separate kitchen and bathroom. We have a small patio with a table and two chairs outside. The place is run as a B&B, so there is a laundry machine available and several small units for our family and friends to use when they visit (hint, hint!).

After moving in on Monday, we ran around to a number of stores on Tuesday to get supplies that we needed. There are quite a number of food, clothing, and general merchandise stores around us so we found most of what we needed. We feel like it&#8217;s going to work out nicely here.

This morning, we went in for our first day of work. We will be working in the offices of the Ministry of Health with the team working on their electronic medical records system. This involves gathering the requirements, creating a usable system, collecting the right data, and reporting on the indicators needed by eSwatini and the various international agencies. Their biggest priority is reducing HIV infection rates and improving treatment, but a good medical records system makes it easier to focus on a healthy population across a variety of indicators.

In one day, we met quite a few people, and will hopefully remember at least of few of their names! There are many subgroups in the department with many responsibilities. They are well-focused on what needs to be done, but right now it&#8217;s a long list. We are excited to get up to speed on their systems and processes so we can hopefully contribute soon!
