So Lilly and I have been fairly busy, but I&#8217;ll put together a few blog posts now.

Last week we went to the beach in Minamisanriku, an area hit pretty hard in the tsunami in 2011. In fact, the beach only reopened for public use last year. It&#8217;s a pretty nice little town though and the beach was very nice.

There were a few food stalls setup on one end of the beach, so we got snacks there first before going swimming. We went with a few other ALTs as we didn&#8217;t have our car yet, so we had to wait around a bit while the others tried to find us. Once we had all arrived we sunscreened up and jumped in the water.

The beach was pretty warm and the water was refreshing, not warm but definitely not cold. It was apparently Lilly&#8217;s first time swimming in a non-hypothermia inducing ocean, so she got to learn about mouthfuls of salt water and the like. For those not in Oregon, we have beaches but they&#8217;re very cold.

After we swam for a while, we decided to make a sand castle while we waited for some late arrivers to make it. The kids on the beach seemed to think it was pretty funny watching a bunch of adult foreigners trying to build a sandcastle too close to the water. After we finished building it, we decided to try and keep it alive until the others joined us, so we had to build large walls to protect it from the incoming tide.

One the last few people arrived, we did a tad more swimming and eating before heading over to a shrine that was attached to an island from the end of the beach. The hike was fairly steep but not too long or muddy despite recent rain. The shrine was neat but rather small and plain. The small island was hit pretty hard in the tsunami as well.

Afterwards we did a bit more swimming before heading over to a small market nearby. Some shops were closed because last week was Oban (a weeklong festival), but we did grab some stuff from a cute bakery. After that we headed to a coffee shop in Tome that the ALTs really like before heading home for the day.
