*Makhwapheni (mock-wah-pay&#8217;-nee) &#8211; Temporary lover*

After working hard alongside the Swazis the past almost 8 months to assist with building up their medical records system, the plug has been pulled.

The journey has been hard at times. Coming as the latest in a line of various volunteers and other organizations, it&#8217;s hard to assure people that we are there to help and won&#8217;t just start some crazy new thing and then run off. Our focus has been to try to add features to their EMR (electronic medical records system) and update some of their processes to enable them to offer the care the population needs (by their invitation and working on their priorities). Coming from a different background, our experience includes things that haven&#8217;t been tried here so we worked to train/mentor local people so they would be able to utilize these techniques for the long haul. The Peace Corps&#8217; definition of success includes leaving an organization in a state that they don&#8217;t need you anymore. If we can&#8217;t leave without things falling apart, we&#8217;ve failed.

Makhwapheni (from the post heading) apparently means &#8220;temporary lover.&#8221; There are always (in every environment) people who are resistant to change, looking for a reason to discount new ideas. Makhwapheni implies that since we&#8217;re just the most recent in a string of &#8220;lovers,&#8221; we don&#8217;t need to be taken seriously. This general idea also leads to questions about extending our time to get more done. At this point, we weren&#8217;t really interested in extending though since the goal was to pass along knowledge and perspective, then get back to family and friends. Now it&#8217;s out of our hands regardless and we can&#8217;t even finish our commitment. That&#8217;s really the worst possible case since we weren&#8217;t able to get things to the point of hand-off, and it basically validates their initial worries. It&#8217;s all kind of surreal at the moment.

We&#8217;ll write another post soon with more details. At the moment we don&#8217;t have any more information to give. Volunteers are all waiting at their posts for further instructions, packing and reflecting. Stay tuned&#8230;
