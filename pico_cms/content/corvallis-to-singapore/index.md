We’re in Asia!

The adventure began on Thursday. I was feeling much better after finishing a two-week course of antibiotics that left me tired and nauseous. We finished up our two-week house-sitting gig by taking the elderly labradoodle, Tanner, on a lovely walk around the neighborhood.

We finished packing at my parents’ house, and then my family escorted us to Portland by way of a healthy dinner out. We met up with Dr. Barstow, Mesa, and Kalie to trade stories over a leisurely second dinner (paid for by Dr. Barstow’s ridiculous frequent-flyer rewards).&nbsp;

We four hopped to San Francisco, then got on a gigantic Singapore Airlines plane for the 15-hour nighttime flight to Hong Kong. It certainly helped that the flight attendants handed out hot towels and two warm meals, but a flight that long is bound to be uncomfortable! (We’ve eaten at least twice the usual number of meals for this timeframe&#8230;) We arrived at the Hong Kong airport without a single hitch. In fact, it was eerie that we saw zero signs of the recent protests. We had a layover long enough to go “Whoaaaa we’re in China”, and then we congregated again to return to the exact same seats. It’s a good thing, too! Turns out we’ve had a super cool seatmate this entire time. Ananya is a junior (like me!) studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Product Design at UC Berkeley, and she’s headed home to Singapore. Just like the protagonist of the book I listened to while sitting next to her on the 14-hour flight, she comes from a Sikh Punjabi family. We’ve had quite a lot to talk about on this flight from Hong Kong to Singapore — school, work, mental health, politics, religion, travel, programming languages, how I fainted into Gabriel’s arms while I received a shot in the butt two days after our wedding, and so on. Look Mom, we’re socializing!
