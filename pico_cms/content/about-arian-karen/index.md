Arian and Karen are living in eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) for a year as part of a Peace Corps Response project with the Ministry of Health to develop their electronic medical records (EMR/EHR) system.

It should be pointed out that everything they say is their own and not, in any way, endorsed by the Peace Corps or US Government.

Our son Damian and his wife Lilly will be living in Tome, Japan for a year with the Japanese Exchange and Teaching (JET) program with Lilly teaching in some local schools while Damian continues with his current job as a remote worker.

Our son Gabriel and his wife Kendrea spent a semester abroad (August &#8211; December) in Nepal near Boudhanath, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, where classes were held at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. They have since returned home.
