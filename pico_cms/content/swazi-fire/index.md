![This was our first introduction to Swazi Fire. They served the hot sauce during our training week. It was sitting innocently at the end of the table in an unlabelled bowl. I thought to myself, I like salsa… Wow, nope! I quickly learned that they are not kidding around with their hot sauce! A tiny amount goes a long way!](assets/2019/10/319027-Eswatini-Swazi-Kitchen-Swazi-Fire-Sauce-275g-new.jpg)

 

![There&#8217;s plenty of literal fires though too! They burn small areas to clear away the brush and reduce the chance of a bigger more dangerous fire.](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190827_172139.jpg)

![Eswatini is also where the Kniphofia plant comes from. For those who don&#8217;t know, in Oregon people plant them in their flower gardens and call them Red Hot Pokers. Get it? It&#8217;s another type of Swazi Fire!!! 😅](assets/2019/10/downloadfile-5.jpg)

 

![This is not really on topic, but it&#8217;s a pretty flower that we see along the roadside on our walk to work. Also, it reminds me of a little flame. I don&#8217;t know the name though.](assets/2019/10/MVIMG_20190915_174920.jpg)

 

![Speaking of our walk to work, here is a picture looking out across the street from the building where I usually work.](assets/2019/10/MVIMG_20190910_174711.jpg)

 

![Last week one of our meetings was at the UN building. Arian was very flattered to be mistaken for 007! ](assets/2019/09/MVIMG_20190911_120233-7.jpg)

 

![I was impressed by how cheerfully decorated the building is inside. It&#8217;s very different from the UN building in Geneva, Switzerland!](assets/2019/10/MVIMG_20190911_111404.jpg)

 

![Even the lizards are colorful here. These little guys with the turquoise blue heads are pretty common.](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190909_135657-1.jpg)

 

![Back at the office, here is a truck with the logo and name of the health information system that we are here to help improve. They use this truck to drive out to remote health facilities and support the system users. One type of vehicle that neither of us have seen yet &#8211; a firetruck!](assets/2019/09/MVIMG_20190914_172454-3.jpg)
