For the last week we&#8217;ve been attending various events at Rangjung Yeshe Institute orientation. I should prolly start with some background info about the school:

*   Rangjung Yeshe Institute (RYI) operates inside a Buddhist monastery.
*   The monastery is named &#8220;Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling&#8221;, but most locals know it as &#8220;The White Monastery&#8221;.
    *   &#8220;Ka-Nying&#8221; stands for Kagyu and Nyingma, which are two of the four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism.
    *   &#8220;Shedrub&#8221; means monks can take classes there, kind of like seminary (more on this shortly).
*   The monastery is in Boudhanath, a Tibetan neighborhood of Kathmandu.
*   Kathmandu University (KU) and RYI work together to offer credit for classes at RYI. This agreement is how we get OSU credit.
*   RYI and KU operate on the semester schedule, so a full course load of 16 semester credits gets us 22.5 term credits back at home. This means we can drop a class while still keeping our credits per term above the scholarship threshold.

Scholastic work for monastics is done at a &#8220;shedrub&#8221; (remember that that&#8217;s in the monastery name). We do classes at RYI, which gives Western-compatible credits (through KU) for Western- and shedrub-style classes. We will be taking one such shedrub-style class from a Khenpo, the monastic scholar equivalent of a doctorate.

Almost all the classes are taught in English; Khenpo classes have Tibetan instructors and therefore a translator, but some higher-level Khenpo classes don&#8217;t have translators!

Now for actual information about the orientation! There are around 40 of us newcomers, and we attended many information sessions about food/water safety, earthquake preparedness, who to talk to if we&#8217;re stressed, proper etiquette for monastery and academic settings, etc. We also took prep classes in either Nepali or Tibetan. We chose Nepali, since that&#8217;s what our host family speaks. Overall, RYI offers language courses in Nepali, classical Tibetan, colloquial Tibetan, and Sanskrit.

Our classmates are ridiculously diverse. We&#8217;ve already made friends with people from Germany, Tibet, Finland, Argentina, Ecuador, Korea, Mexico, India, and Netherlands! Most people are around our age, but there are maybe 5 or 10 older people in their 40s-60s. There are also a few monks and nuns.

One very comforting thing about RYI is that you take off your shoes before entering classrooms, offices, or the library. There are shelves outside each door where you put your shoes. Also, many of the classrooms don&#8217;t have chairs, so you sit on the floor.

![The wooden benches are not to be sat upon or even stepped over, since they&#8217;re used for studying religious texts.](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190819_103310.jpg)

Many of the orientation lunches were provided at the monastery-owned Utpala Café, a short walk from the part of campus with classes. Being part of a monastery that does outreach to help all sentient beings, it should be no surprise that their whole menu is at least vegetarian, and whatever isn&#8217;t vegan can be easily substituted.

    *   Buddhist Philosophy and Hermeneutics (taught by a Khenpo)
    *   Nepali 1
*   Kendrea is taking Buddhist Ethics
*   Gabriel is taking Anthropological Study of Nepalese Religions (taught by Fr. Greg)
