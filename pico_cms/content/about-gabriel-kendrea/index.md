## Biography

Hello! We’re Kendrea and Gabriel Kulp.

Kendrea is a third-year student at Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science and Philosophy and minoring in Mathematics; she’s interested in computer ethics and Effective Altruism. Gabriel is a fourth-year student at OSU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Physics; he’s interested in computer security and its relationship with civil liberties.&nbsp;

We enjoy singing, playing musical instruments, messing around with computers, unicycling, interacting with various living creatures, and taking naps. We got married in July 2019, almost exactly a month before leaving for Nepal.
