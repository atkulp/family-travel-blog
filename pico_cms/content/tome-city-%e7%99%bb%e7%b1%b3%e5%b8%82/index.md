Today is our fourth day in Japan, and it&#8217;s been a bit of a long one!

Before today, yesterday Damian and I had a chance to spend time with a very good friend of mine, Yurika, who I&#8217;ve known since high school. It had been a very long time since I&#8217;d seen her and we had a really good time hanging out together.

We finished up the last of the Tokyo Orientation yesterday, and this morning we checked out bright and early to make our way with a group of other Miyagi JETs to Sendai, the capital of Miyagi Prefecture. We got on the shinkansen, or bullet train, at about 8 am, after spending a lot of time walking and riding trains through Tokyo with quite a bit of baggage.

After the shinkansen, we walked to the Sendai board of education to greet and be greeted by the people in charge. We also met my supervisor, the extremely helpful and resourceful Sato-san. He has helped us immensely, preparing numerous items and lots and lots of information to make our transition as smooth as possible. He&#8217;s our hero!

After the BOE in Sendai, Sato-san and another JET ALT named Kai drove us and our fellow Tome JET to Tome proper, where we finished the process to declare our residency in Tome. Finally, we headed over to our very, extremely, ridiculously empty apartment. I will dedicate another post to the apartment itself, but for now I will leave you with this lovely shot of Damian in a doorway of our new home.
