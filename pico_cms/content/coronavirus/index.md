Hello everyone!

I&#8217;m writing this brief post to give everyone an update on the situation here in Japan. Some of you may have heard that Abe Shinzo, Japan&#8217;s prime minister, made an announcement last week that all of the schools in Japan would be closed for the next several weeks. It was really a suggestion, but as my school district decided to close school, you may be wondering what all this means for Damian and I.

For the most part, our day-to-day doesn&#8217;t really change. Damian isn&#8217;t affected at all, as he works from home, and I&#8217;m actually still going to work. School is closed for the kids, but teachers are actually still required to go in.

So, for the next month until the new school year, I&#8217;m going to be spending a lot of time at my desk. I will probably be doing prep, Japanese language study, and discreet reading. In all honesty, I&#8217;m probably going to be extremely bored for the next month until the new school year starts (The school year starts in April in Japan). However, I will still be working and it&#8217;s pretty much business as usual.

Damian and I are doing fine, and we&#8217;re mildly amused with the antics of some people overreacting to the situation.

Look forward to some older posts that we&#8217;ve been working on! We&#8217;ll be sure to keep everyone updated with the goings on out here.
