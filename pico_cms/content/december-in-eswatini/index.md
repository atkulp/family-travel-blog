It seemed strange to be preparing for Christmas with the sun shining so warmly.&nbsp; To help get into the holiday spirit, Arian joined a small singing group.&nbsp; They lead Christmas caroling at a community center in town.&nbsp; The kids joined right in and a good time was had by all.

We also had the opportunity to attend a youth Christmas concert.&nbsp; The event was organized by a Taiwanese program that provides musical instruction to high-risk youth.&nbsp; They teach the children traditional Swazi dance, western choral music, and orchestral instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, they provide apprenticeships for local musicans who are interested in learning to be instructors.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun to see how much the program has accomplished in only two years!

The most exciting thing about December was knowing that we would soon be seeing Damian, Lilly, Gabriel, and Kendrea in Japan! We will be with them for two weeks. Definitely makes the year easier!
