We had a great trip on Saturday! We took a khumbi for a 30 minute ride to Malolotja Nature Reserve. It was an adventure just getting there since we weren&#8217;t entirely sure where to get off! Once there, we hiked around and explored under the watchful eyes of lots of gazelles (or impalas, we weren&#8217;t sure&#8230;). There were interesting rocks and lots of ups and downs

It was beautiful with good views. It was a hot day, but there were good breezes, especially on the hilltops.

In addition to the rocks, we saw lots of flowers in bloom as well.

![Not sure what this, but it&#8217;s on the cover of the Eswatini Visitor&#8217;s Guide so it must be special!](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190921_152130-1024x469-1024x469.jpg)

After a few kilometers, we got to a lookout point where we thought we&#8217;d see the famed Malolotja Falls (highest in the country). It turned out that the overlook didn&#8217;t actually provide any view&#8230; so that was disappointing. It was a beautiful view of the plains and valleys though. As we looked left, we noticed movement. We assumed it was more of the impalas or gazelles we kept seeing, but then we realized that we were seeing a herd of zebras! They were pretty far off, so I decided to try to approach them to get some photos. I walked slowly, and followed Karen&#8217;s advice to keep looking at the ground and ambling around more than just walking straight and looking at them. My ploy failed.

![Look at that! You see those zebras right? Just a few hundred meters away but still just specks in the picture.](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190921_153741-1-1024x469-1024x469.jpg)

Every minute or so they&#8217;d start kicking up dust and jumping around, settling down a little farther away. Eventually, I gave up. Unfortunately, as with many cell phone cameras, I can&#8217;t really zoom so I don&#8217;t have any decent pictures to share. A real camera/lens combo would have yielded some great shots!

Past the zebras, we walked downhill, toward the waterfall. It was quite a bit farther than we&#8217;d hoped (even though we were warned!). It was a beautiful landscape, but much drier and open than we&#8217;re used to. We saw a sign for Ibis nesting. It said trail closed, but we had already been told by a ranger to ignore it. I&#8217;m assuming it just hadn&#8217;t been taken down yet.

The final part of the hike was a steeper decline. We got about halfway down and decided it was far enough since we could see it! We stood by an edge and got some shots.

![You can see the water flowing toward the right. You can&#8217;t tell, but it&#8217;s quite a bit farther down to get there. This is why a need a good 3d camera&#8230;](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190921_155807-1024x469-1024x469.jpg)

It didn&#8217;t look that impressive from there, but we didn&#8217;t think it was a good idea to keep going and have to retrace that much more.

![Peeking over the cliff edge we can see the waterfall way down below. Any farther down would feel 10x worse going back up!](assets/2019/10/IMG_20190921_155930-1024x469-1024x469.jpg)

As we returned, we came across a patch of grass that was noticeably more lush. Getting closer we could tell that it was damp, saturated ground. Being on an incline and seeing this, with no stream or other water nearby seemed odd! Upon closer inspection, we saw that the water was bubbling up from under a rock! It was a little spring.

On the way back, I had to take a picture of the road. Talk about parched land! Despite the river and waterfall only a few kilometers away, there was no water here&#8230;

On the last leg of our hike, we noticed some very unusual rocks. I&#8217;ve never seen cracks like these before, especially in so many rocks. I&#8217;m not sure what it means, but I know that Eswatini is supposed to be notable for geological reasons.

We made our way back to the road and had to wait a few minutes for the khumbi. The sun was starting to dip down so we started getting worried, but soon enough a ride came by! It was a fun day and we&#8217;re glad to have gotten to see some more of Eswatini&#8217;s natural beauty.
