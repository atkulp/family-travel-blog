On Saturday, we OSU students packed up our things, checked out of Shechen Guest House, trekked in the heat to RYI (we really don&#8217;t recommend walking with rolling suitcases in Kathmandu), met our host families, and headed home with them for the first time!

Gabriel and I are staying in a three-story house in a fancy part of town with two brothers (Roshan and Milan) who work in the financial sector, their mother (Ranju), Milan&#8217;s 10-year-old son (Ishan), and at least one servant (Saili). Roshan is married, but his wife and son live in another house with his in-laws (and now Mesa from OSU!). The third floor consists of Roshan&#8217;s bedroom, our bedroom, a shared living room, a shared bathroom and a nifty two-level balcony. Roshan and Milan speak English pretty well, Grandma and Ishan speak a little, and Saili speaks none, but I&#8217;ve bonded a lot with her just by smiling and gesturing.

The family members belong to the highest Hindu caste — Brahmin — so Gabriel and I, as outcastes, have to avoid ritually polluting them or their home with our presence. We stay out of the kitchen and shrine area. Menstruating women aren&#8217;t allowed in the kitchen. (Nepal is mostly Hindu, so it&#8217;s not a surprise that we&#8217;re staying with a Hindu family. We&#8217;re studying Buddhism, though, which does not have a caste system.)

Milan and Roshan have crazy busy work schedules, so we&#8217;ve spent by far the most time with Grandma. Saili and Grandma serve us food and clear our dishes. It&#8217;s a constant struggle to insist that we&#8217;re full and don&#8217;t need any more food! Grandma sits with us as we eat. She used to teach Nepali language, so she has taken it upon herself to teach us a bunch! Between Nepali lessons during RYI orientation and informal lessons with Grandma, I estimate we&#8217;ve learned 100 words so far. Not bad for three days.

The food is DELICIOUS. They cook nearly the same thing for lunch and dinner every single day: dal (lentil soup), bhat (rice), tarkari (vegetable curry), Nepali salad (just cucumber and carrot), and achar (various kinds of spicy pickles, analogous to salsa). It&#8217;s my favorite cuisine, so I don&#8217;t mind the repetition at all. Plus, you can imagine that you get *really *good at cooking something when you make it twice a day for decades! I really hope that Grandma or Saili will agree to give us cooking lessons sometime.

![Meals are no-phone zones, so I snuck this picture when Grandma left the room mid-meal. I mixed together my dal, bhat, and tarkari on the bottom. At the top from left to right, you can see crunchy seasoned soybeans, pea salad with ginger and vinegar, and &#8220;baby French fries&#8221; (as Gabriel calls them). ](assets/2019/10/img_3977.jpg)

Side note: our intrepid guide Dr. Barstow went home to Oregon a week ago. It was great having him along, but we don&#8217;t mind the increased independence now that we have our feet under us!
