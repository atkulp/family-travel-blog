We have been holding a number of meetings and working hard studying the source code for their systems while Karen is studying their business requirements and clinical environment. There is a large push to add some new features for HIV tracking so we need to ask a lot of questions and really understand what we&#8217;re doing!

As part of this acclimation, I&#8217;ve been to see two clinics: one run by the Red Cross, the other by the Salvation Army. It was surprising to see a chapel in the same building as the Salvation Army clinic, but Swazis are much more comfortable with religion not just being confined to church buildings. They even start many meetings with a prayer. So far they have been a generally humble and unassuming people who are very friendly and open about their beliefs.

The clinics do standard vitals, immunizations, and exams, but they also proactively do HIV testing on everyone they can in other to get people in treatment and educate them on how to live with or avoid it. They have done a great job of reducing new infections through awareness campaigns and talking frankly about the risks of sexual activity. It&#8217;s been quite successful, but they continue to do everything they can to eradicate it.

Each clinic has it&#8217;s own challenges with power and network connectivity. The systems deployed need to be resilient in addition to user-friendly and feature-packed.

In our workplace, I sit in a shared office with another Peace Corps volunteer (Noah), a business analyst, and a empty desk people float to. Karen sits in a similar office with data management folks. Noah and I also have desks at the office for the international consulting firm FEI across the street. We go back and forth working with various people.

We&#8217;ve gotten our SiSwati names given to us by our officemates! Since my name means &#8220;silver&#8221;in Welsh, I&#8217;m Ngcebo (the&#8221;c&#8221; is a click) which means precious (as in metal). Karen is Buhle which means beautiful lady!

Due to where we live, we can walk to work in about ten minutes but don&#8217;t actually pass many businesses. The building where we work houses a number of other government and NGO offices but not much commerce.

On our way home, we pass a guy who sells roasted corn most days. It&#8217;s shucked and fire roasted which gives it a great flavor, though it&#8217;s much chewier than I&#8217;m used to corn being. The guy who sells it always gives us a big smile when we pass by.

As we turn to head up the very steep hill towards our place, there is an alcove at the base with carvings/sculptings of famous people. I believe it&#8217;s currently Nelson Mandela, Bob Marley, and their current ruler King Mswati III. It&#8217;s an interesting medium. He also makes dog houses and a few other items.

This morning (Saturday), we meet with another volunteer who has been working with Swazis running a program to introduce girls to STEM. Many of the rural schools don&#8217;t have any computers so the kids don&#8217;t even have mouse skills. The program starts with beginner computer concepts (turning it on, typing, mouse, windows, files) moves on to Microsoft Office, and even offers a game development class. Certificates are given for completion, and the kids work on a resume to showcase their new skills. Karen, Noah, and I are excited about helping where we can!
