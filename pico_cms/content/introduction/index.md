We’re going to Nepal! And we’re blogging about it. We hope that the blog will help us keep in touch with friends and family, share what we learn, and remember the trip in future years.

We leave mid-August and return late December 2019. We’ll live near Kathmandu (Nepal’s capital). Specifically, we’ll stay with a host family in the town of Boudhanath, which has a rich Tibetan-influenced culture. (The Himalayan mountain range divides Nepal from the China-controlled Tibetan plateau.) We’ll attend the&nbsp;[Rangjung Yeshe Institute][1], an international school based at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery called&nbsp;[Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling][2]. We’ll both take classes in Buddhist Philosophy and Hermeneutics, Anthropology of Nepalese Religion, and Nepali Language.&nbsp;

We owe this opportunity to&nbsp;[Dr. Geoff Barstow][3]&nbsp;from the School of History, Philosophy, and Religion at Oregon State University (OSU). Last fall, he visited my World Religions class to talk about this study abroad opportunity. I immediately got super excited, but didn’t have much hope that I could actually go. As a concession, I signed up for his course about Buddhist ethics in the spring. Then, we learned about the plans Lilly & Damian and Karen & Arian had for the year&#8230; suddenly, moving halfway across the world ourselves seemed less ridiculous! Dr. Barstow turned out to be an outstanding and highly approachable professor, so we had plenty of chances to ask him questions about studying abroad. We’ve met the other five students from OSU who will also go on this trip: Jesus (who was in my Buddhist ethics class), Kalie (whose best friend we know from Gabriel’s church), Yuki (who I helped with German pronunciation in choir last year), Yi-Hsiang (whose family lives near Tibet), and Mesa (who goes to OSU-Cascades in Bend, Oregon).&nbsp;

If you’d like a refresher at any time about who we are and what we’re talking about, see our biography and glossary on the &#8220;[About Gabriel & Kendrea][4]&#8221; page. Please keep in touch! For our part, we’ll do our best to keep this interesting.
