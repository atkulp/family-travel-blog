Damian and Lilly finished their degrees at Oregon State University, got married, and are heading to Japan; it&#8217;s been a busy year!

Lilly was accepted into the Japanese Exchange and Teaching (JET) program and placed in [Tome, Japan][1]. She&#8217;ll be primarily teaching elementary schoolers at Minamikata Elementary School, though she&#8217;ll make weekly and monthly trips to 2 other elementary schools and 2 kindergartens for a total of 5 schools. Lilly is the first full time JET Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) that Minamikata Elementary has had.

Damian is continuing to work for Citycounty Insurance Services (CIS).&nbsp; The time difference means that he has to wake up really early to have 4 hours of overlap with Oregon.&nbsp; Since CIS is for Oregon cities and counties, they were a little unsure of having a remote worker from Japan but it&#8217;s been working out so far!&nbsp; Damian also didn&#8217;t have any Japanese skills upon first arriving.&nbsp; He has to spend a lot of time learning the various written languages used here as well as trying to learn the culture.

We&#8217;ll be in Tome for a full year, returning around mid-late August 2020.
