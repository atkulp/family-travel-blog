Less than 24 hours to go for Arian and Karen until getting on the first plane! Preparing has been more difficult than expected. We&#8217;ve moved before, but this time we need to decide for every item if we are giving away, selling, storing, or bringing with us. How much do we bring for a year? How much of our stuff do we really need to store? Selling off our house and cars is somewhat liberating, but trying to be sure we are bringing everything we need is a challenge. We can&#8217;t just Amazon Prime a forgotten item! On the other hand, there will be stores (it is the capitol city!), and maybe there will be some kind of internet delivery possible. We&#8217;ll just have to see. It&#8217;s going to be a grand adventure!
