So it&#8217;s now Thursday. We&#8217;ve been in training since Monday, but in eSwatini since Friday or so. It&#8217;s been pretty intense overall. Our days are planned from 7am until 7pm. Breakfast, then language, then tea time, then a lecture followed by lunch. A few more lectures, then an off block (&#8220;wellness&#8221;) followed by supper at 6. Outside of hours, we are restricted to campus. We can&#8217;t drive, and we aren&#8217;t all that comfortable with transit yet. The surrounding area (not really a neighborhood) has a number of street vendors, but it&#8217;s not really a place to wander around.

Today, we took our first trip on the local transportation, the khumbi (koom-bee), where we needed to communicate in SiSwati to find the right ride, learn the price, pay, get off at the right spot, etc. Our language teachers accompanied us so we wouldn&#8217;t be completely terrified!

These are very different from American buses! They drive past rather frequently and you need to hail them to stop, then make sure they are going where you want to go. There are places they tend to stop, but only the Swazis seem to understand where! You sit on a bench seat. It&#8217;s crowded, but only as much as there are seat belts. No standing since khumbis are really just passenger vans. Then the driver gets going to the destination. At some point, sometimes not until you get off, the conductor asks for the fare. The conductor accompanies the driver but sits with the passengers to answer questions, determine if there is space for another person, and handle money so the driver can drive. It&#8217;s all by hand, nothing electronic or computerized.

The ends of routes are usually the bus ranks. Think of a bus station, but then stop thinking of a bus station. It&#8217;s not really anything like that. A huge number of khumbis wait for people, their conductors calling out. It&#8217;s densely packed with people and vehicles trying to get where they need to be. Also lots of fruit and other vendors. Somehow it works out!

A word on language&#8230; We understood that English was the official language so knowing the local language, SiSwati (a Zulu relative), was mostly for making a good impression. It turns out that SiSwati is still used quite a lot. People freely switch back and forth, and outside of offices, English is definitely second-class. It is true that, even in offices, being able to greet and introduce yourself in SiSwati is important.

Speaking of offices, we visited the official Peace Corps office in Mbabane today. It&#8217;s somehow part of the embassy, though a different building. Security to get in, phones left at the door, etc. Once inside though, it was a pleasant yard and a pretty normal office building. We went over some things and had another briefing. They take our safety and wellbeing very seriously so we talk about how it all works, our role, their role, etc. pretty often.

One more full day of training. We still have language Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, but after tomorrow much less lecture and more traveling/sightseeing/shopping. I&#8217;m looking forward to finally seeing our actual residence in Mbabane. We&#8217;ve met our counterparts at the Ministry of Health so we have an idea of how our project will go. We&#8217;re almost there!
