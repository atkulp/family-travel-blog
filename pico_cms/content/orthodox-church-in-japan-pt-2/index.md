On the 15th, we were invited, along with a lot of other people from the area, to the consecration of St. John the Forerunner in Nakanida. Unfortunately, this was the first consecration I&#8217;ve been to, and my liturgical Japanese is&#8230; lacking.

The building was pretty darn full when we arrived, there were probably about 100 people there. This event had been announced all over the area so we drove an hour and there were definitely people that came from farther. There was also the choir from Sendai which came to sing and we really appreciated them!

Concelebrating was His Eminence, Bishop Seraphim of Sendai, 5 priests from the area including our Father Luke, the protodeacon from Sendai, and a collection of alter servers (no subdeacons though).

There was a whole lot of stuff going on that neither Lilly nor I could understand, but there were several parts of the consecration service that we still managed to figure out! The first was when all of a sudden there was a lot of very loud banging from behind the alter, then the bishop opened the beautiful gates wearing an apron over his robes and you could see the wooden structure of the alter being assembled. I couldn&#8217;t quite get a picture of it since I didn&#8217;t know it was coming ☹️

After the consecration was done, they launched into liturgy which was our first hierarchical service here. Things went pretty much as expected, though it was fun to see everything in Japanese with so many clergy. We&#8217;ve definitely gotten used to small, intimate services during our time here.

Finally, agreed the service was done, everyone went outside and took a picture of everyone in front of the new church. After that, we ask headed over to a banquet at a nearby hotel where we were fed some pretty yummy food and listened to lots of speeches.

During the banquet we talked to some Russian ladies that were all excited to talk to the young Russian family that had showed up. Unfortunately for them, neither of us knows Russian, so they were a bit sad and surprised. One of them spoke English though and we talked for a bit. We made some friends from the Sendai area!

We also got to talk to a French dude who worked on the iconostasis. Apparently a Japanese-French dude started a carpentry shop after moving to Japan from France. He then attracted some French people that wanted to learn Japanese carpentry and they work mostly on shrines. When they heard there was an Orthodox church starting in town, they wanted to take the job. The guy said that it was a really fun job, that they all really enjoyed making the iconostasis, and that they hoped they would get the opportunity to work on Orthodox churches again in the future. He also said that they used many, many different kinds of Japanese woods to make iconostasis and that it was fun to weave Japanese culture and orthodoxy together.
