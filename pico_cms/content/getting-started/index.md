We landed at King Mswati III International airport. It was very nice, but amazingly quiet compared to the last few airports!

The airport had large photos of the king, the queen mother, and the prime minister.

Customs was quick and painless and we were on our way thanks to a ride in a comfortable van courtesy of the program director.

From the airport, we had over an hour&#8217;s drive to Manzini where we are staying. The entire drive we saw roads under construction and relatively low traffic. Along the road there were unfenced cows and goats, along with many vendor stalls with fruits, baskets, bowls, and roasted corn.

We’re finally here and ready to get started. “Here” is the campus of the Institute of Development Management, where Peace Corps has dorms and classrooms. Everyone is doubling up to reduce room count. Fortunately they let Karen and me be roomies!

We found out that we won&#8217;t get local sim cards until Monday. That means no data, SMS, etc. It would have been nice to know we&#8217;d have data blackout for the first two days!Our cohort consists of eight people, including us. Three of them are medical along with one in sociology, there to teach, one is a videographer shooting training and other videos, then there&#8217;s a programmer I&#8217;ll be working with, plus Karen and me. One did regular Peace Corps years ago, the rest of us are green. No one is much more prepared for what to expect than we are.Today and tomorrow we have some brief orientation sessions. The pre-training lasts a week and starts Monday. During that time we&#8217;ll be doing language and culture lessons, lots of PC rules and policies, and learning more about our positions. It looks to be a pretty busy time. We&#8217;ll be trying out &#8220;normal&#8221; sleep schedules. We&#8217;ll see how it goes!
