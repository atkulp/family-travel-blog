The weather has turned, and with it, life is gently transitioning.

Our host grandma has gotten sick with a cold. She constantly tells us to eat lots of hot food, wear sweaters, and wear slippers so that our feet don’t touch the cold marble. The temperature is… in the high 60s (Fahrenheit). Not so cold by Oregon standards!

As we reach the end of monsoon season, the mosquitos that carry dengue will disappear. We’ve asked maybe ten (!) pharmacies if they have any bug repellent left, and all but one have said no. It looks like our little lavender-scented spray bottle will persevere long enough.

Last Monday, it felt like the right time to get haircuts. My hair now dries much faster, stays out of my way, and (I think) looks pretty nifty! Gabriel briefly had a smooth face, but it yearns to remain hairy, so he already has a solid crop of stubble.

How this hair length came to be: We ducked into the first barber shop we saw. The dude who cut my hair looked about 16, he didn’t speak any English, and he clearly had very little experience. Despite these obstacles, both of my ears are intact. Gabriel’s barber pulled Gabriel’s face all over the place and spread many foamy substances on it. We were both treated to head and back massages afterward: they stretched our arms, popped our knuckles, and whacked us on the head with fists. We were surprised at all the physical contact, because Nepalis will usually never touch another person’s head, especially of someone of the opposite gender. As my mom said, maybe the 16-year-old enjoyed giving me a massage more than I enjoyed receiving it… Anyway, at the end, I saw a poster in Devanagari and figured out that it advertised haircuts for $1 (100 Nepali rupees), not $5 as they had told us. I kept quiet, figuring that this was still a good deal. I paid $10 (to cover both of us) and tried to leave, but then a barber asked for $7 more for the shave! Now that they were really trying to overcharge us, I pointed out the low price on the poster, and they let us go. I’m glad that we 1) gave them a tip because we could afford it, 2) didn’t let them totally rip us off, and best of all, 3) showed that foreigners might know more than they let on 😉

As of September 18, we’ve been married as long in Nepal as in the United States!

Yesterday, we had a lovely time visiting Yuki’s apartment with Mesa and Jesus. We folded origami cranes for Mesa’s friend, who has cancer, as we chatted and I read an Anthropology textbook chapter out loud.

I jotted down the nationalities of all of my Ethics classmates. (Since then, I’ve switched out of Ethics, but these proportions are pretty representative.)

*   Nepal (monk)
*   India
*   Germany
*   Sweden
*   Vietnam
*   Bhutan
*   Bhutan
*   Ecuador
*   Netherlands
*   US
*   Germany
*   Brazil (nun)
*   France/Switzerland
*   Russia (nun)

Things are going well. We’re glad we switched into different classes — the new ones are much more engaging and relevant to us. Gabriel and I both feel healthy now that we’ve settled into a routine with good exercise, rest, and food. This semester doesn’t need to be a huge adventure; we can treat it as a quiet retreat.

We’ve updated the  to add members of our host family.

Here’s a 2-minute [time-lapse ][1][video][1] of our 15-minute walk to school!

Sending warm wishes for your own autumnal transitions!
