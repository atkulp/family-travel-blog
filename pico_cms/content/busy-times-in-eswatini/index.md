I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to a post for a few weeks now, but it keeps getting pushed aside due to conflicting priorities. We&#8217;ve been hard at work trying to bring updates to [CMIS][1] (Client Management Information System), Eswatini&#8217;s EMR (Electronic Medical Records system). This involves adding new requested features, rearranging the code base to best support our needs, and working through bugs (existing ones and ones we&#8217;ve introduced!).

This week we&#8217;ve spent hours inside and outside of work prototyping some new features for the system. Currently, CMIS is primarily used in almost 200 clinics for outpatient work, that is, visits that don&#8217;t involve checking into a hospital. Many of these clinics focus on HIV, TB, or other diseases, while also providing other regular medical services. Supporting the needs of an inpatient facility (a hospital) requires a very different way of working with the system, but is necessary to offer the best care at all points of service. There are still very many scenarios that require paper forms to capture data within a facility or to transfer information about a patient between facilities. No more paper!

All next week we will be participating in sessions with various stakeholders (doctors, nurses, regional representatives) as we try to come to consensus about some of these changes to make sure that we have buy-in for what&#8217;s likely to be some new ways of doing things in the system. Clinicians all have their own optimized workflows to deal with their patient load, and introducing an EMR (no matter how good) will also slow things down at first. We are hoping that with enough input, we can minimize this friction and make it a positive thing.

In other news, the weather has continued to bounce up and down. On one day, sweating through my shirt on the way to work before 8am, then the next day wishing I had grabbed a jacket! There needs to be some work toward better weather management. I haven&#8217;t figured out who to complain to yet&#8230;

Here&#8217;s a gallery of pictures randomly representing our past two weeks or so:
