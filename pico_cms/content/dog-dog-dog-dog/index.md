Kathmandu has many street dogs. I don’t know much, but I do know that they often lead tough lives and their bites are responsible for the vast majority of human rabies cases in Nepal. Some look chubby and healthy; others look skinny, injured, and afflicted by various ailments. They’re territorial, so they often get into loud fights about who gets to live where. , Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche’s charity, works hard for their welfare.

Now for the cute dog photos&#8230;
