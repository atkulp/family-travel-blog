For me, the last couple of weeks have been focused around work and trying to understand the nuances of the project at hand.&nbsp; Understandably, making improvements to the national health information system is an enormous task.&nbsp; There are a dizzying number of pressing issues to address and that makes prioritization a challenge.&nbsp; Next week I will travel to an outlying health facility to observe how clinical staff are trained to use the current version of the electronic health record software.&nbsp; That will definitely be interesting to see!

Tomorrow there is a Trade Fair in a nearby town.&nbsp; Hopefully that will provide lots of opportunities for photos.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;on Monday we will have a day off from work for a national holiday.&nbsp; We are planning to attend the festivities with some of our fellow Peace Corps volunteers.&nbsp; As much as I am eager to dig into the work, I am happy to have the opportunity to relax a bit and see more of the country.
