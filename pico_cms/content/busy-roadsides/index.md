I thought I&#8217;d use this post to talk about something interesting I&#8217;ve noticed here. The country is relatively poor, with most people making less than $1 USD/day, but there is no end to the entrepreneurial spirit. Pretty much every roadside is dotted with various vendor stalls. Stands with roasted corn, fruit, salty snacks, and grilled meats to eat, buckets and water tanks, and the ever-present MTN data/airtime cards can be found all over the place. Other stands offer car washes, haircuts, or cell phone repair. Most of the stands are built out of poles (4-5&#8243; diameter), pallets, or corrugated metal, or just the back of a truck.

It&#8217;s super cool to see the many ways people find to make money. Crime is relatively low, despite the poverty, and instead lots of individual businesses abound. Even at work, it seems many people have a side hustle. Pay is low, even for professional jobs, so they are always on the lookout for opportunities.

The variety of items for sale includes clothing, shoes, soap, jewelry, hats, and much more. I&#8217;d love to publish more pictures, but it&#8217;s kind of hard to get images without asking lots of people for permission! I try to be sneaky and get shots when people are facing away, but that&#8217;s not always an option. If I can get more in the future, I&#8217;d love to post more!
