Hello everyone, and goodbye for now! Today Damian and I get on a plane to Narita airport in Tokyo, where I&#8217;ll be oriented for three days before we are sent on our way to Tome on the shinkansen (新幹線), or bullet train! We&#8217;ll be leaving PDX at 11:45 AM Oregon time, and arriving in Japan at 2:00 pm their time on Sunday! So we&#8217;re losing Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, nearly a whole day, in crossing the international dateline.

For those of you who are curious, Japan is 16 hours ahead of the Northwest, which means we&#8217;ll frequently be in tomorrow when you&#8217;re in today. WooOoOOoo, time travel!

We&#8217;re very excited, and we will probably be very busy, but we&#8217;ll be sure to keep everyone updated to the best of our ability.
