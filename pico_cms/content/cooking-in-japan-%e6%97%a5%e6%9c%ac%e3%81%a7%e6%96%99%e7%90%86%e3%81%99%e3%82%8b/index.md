Cooking! A necessity and an enjoyable pastime, and not one of the things I thought would be any different from the States. I wasn&#8217;t completely wrong, but not completely right either.

When we moved into our apartment, there were no appliances in it, at all. No stove, no fridge, no washing machine. Only a wall mounted air conditioner in the main room. There was a lowered section of counter meant for a counter top stove, you can kind of see it to Damian&#8217;s left in the picture above. There also was a space for the refrigerator, which was thankfully given to us a couple of days in along with a microwave. After a couple more weeks of instant food and cold lunches, we got a single electric induction burner!

It&#8217;s been interesting, slowly collecting the things we need to cook like we&#8217;re at home. In Japan people generally don&#8217;t bake anywhere near as much as we do in the States, with the preferred methods of cooking being grilling and boiling. Nearly everything here is cooked on the stove, and large ovens that we have in America that heat with flame or electric coils are impossible to find. Even if we were to find one there would be nowhere to put it!

In Japan what they have are basically souped up microwave-toasteroven-oven combos that use electricity to mimic the kind of direct heat you get with an oven or toaster oven. We gave in and bought one of these recently, and it&#8217;s really been a comfort to have. Aside from that, we do the majority of cooking on our two burner gas stove. It is very very hot, hotter than any gas range I&#8217;ve used before, and it&#8217;s been challenging.

After going through all this trouble I think I can understand better why not many of the other ALTs here in Tome do much cooking, if any. If you already have terrible with cooking, coming to Japan will not make it any easier! Despite that, being able to have home cooked meals, especially some recipes from home, has been lovely. Nothing beats homesickness like the taste of home! Japanese food is delicious, but Japanese people do not spice their food nearly as liberally as we do! But I&#8217;ll leave that for another post.
