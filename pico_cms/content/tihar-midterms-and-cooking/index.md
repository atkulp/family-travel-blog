The title is roughly in order, but midterms spanned several weeks across our classes, so that makes midterms actually overlap Tihar and cooking.

![Let’s begin with a gratuitous puppy picture. ](assets/2019/11/img_4479.jpg)

Anyway, first was Tihar! Nobody seems to know the origins of the word, but Tihar in Nepal is equivalent to Deepawali or Diwali, the Festival of Lights, celebrated across South Asia. It&#8217;s five days long, with specific times to worship/recognize crows, dogs, cows, oxen, the goddess of wealth, and brothers.

Being the Festival of Lights, nearly everyone displays brightly colored lights, often more than what you&#8217;d see during Christmas in the States. It&#8217;s inherently hard to take pictures of, but all the big businesses had 50+ foot-long string lights hanging from the roof down the walls. Additionally, this is the main holiday for fireworks. Compared to American Independence Day, Tihar involves many more firecrackers, and many fewer mortars, fountains, smoke bombs, and sparklers. That along with amplified music late into the night made it hard to sleep!

On the day for crow worship, people put food out for the birds. For the days for dogs, cows, and oxen, those animals get tikka (red forehead dot), good food, and marigold necklaces. For Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, everyone makes a sand mandala on the street outside their house or shop, with a line going inside. This is a greeting to invite the goddess in. For brother worship, sisters put tikka on their brothers. For some reason, we received tikka from our host grandma, and instead of just the red, it was a full rainbow! We also received a gift tray with nuts and fruits.

Over the course of the holiday, we lit fireworks and rockets on the roof, played cards, danced, and took a drive around the city to tour the lights, all with our host family! It was the most interaction we&#8217;ve had since our first day at this house.

Next topic: midterms. It&#8217;s important to note that the classes here are far from what I&#8217;m used to. Computer science lectures, homework, and exams have little in common with anthropology, Nepali language, and analysis of Buddhist texts. We&#8217;ve had to do much more memorization than we&#8217;re used to, but it&#8217;s working out pretty well so far! Many topics are organized in lists, so we need to memorize the content and order of the &#8220;eight branches of this&#8221; and the &#8220;twelve links of that&#8221; and the &#8220;four types of that other thing&#8221; on topics ranging from types of refuge to the physical requirements to generate the supreme virtue (bodhicitta).

Anyway, midterms went well overall. We haven&#8217;t gotten all of our scores back yet, but it&#8217;s pretty easy to gauge performance yourself with these things; you either know it or you don&#8217;t, and if the test asks what you know, you&#8217;re good.

Finally, cooking! Living with a modern Brahmin family these days usually wouldn&#8217;t mean much, but our host grandma is on the traditional side of things. As we mentioned earlier, we weren&#8217;t allowed to cook. However, apparently our homestay coordinator spoke with our host family recently, and they concluded that it&#8217;s okay for us to venture into the kitchen every once in a while. We are very confused about how this change of policy came to be, but we aren&#8217;t complaining. Today, for the first time ever (in Nepal), we cooked our own meal in our own home! It was just a simple stir fry, but navigating someone else&#8217;s kitchen is an order of magnitude more difficult when you don&#8217;t even know what utensils are normal to have!

This isn&#8217;t the first time cooking in Nepal, though. First, we &#8220;cooked&#8221; a &#8220;meal&#8221; at a friend&#8217;s apartment that ended up much less organized than we expected. For the second cooking experience, we made momos (Nepali dumplings filled with cabbage+onion+parsnip+soy+garlic+ginger and dipped in spicy tomato-sesame sauce) at another friend&#8217;s house. Since that second friend lives in a homestay of her own, that was the first Brahmin kitchen we used. The momo-making process was quite labor-intensive, but well worth it for the delicious result!

## **Concluding** thoughts, in no particular order:

We&#8217;re over halfway done!

It&#8217;s November and still short-sleeve weather. It was actually almost too warm today. We found an article about someone complaining about climate change and Nepal&#8217;s &#8220;never-ending summer&#8221;.

Now that it&#8217;s stopped raining with the end of the monsoon season, there&#8217;s nothing to keep the dust out of the air. It just blows around and gets in your eyes and lungs. We have face masks, but they can only help so much.

While shopping for ingredients, the only tofu we found was unwrapped and sitting in a tub of water&#8230; very questionable sanitation. We cooked and ate it anyway. We&#8217;ll let you know if we die.

We finally took a walk around the oasis of wealth that is the 5-star hotel Hyatt Regency Kathmandu! It&#8217;s only a fifth of a mile from our house, but it&#8217;s walled off, so we hadn&#8217;t found a way in before. This time, we went with a friend who has a swimming membership and can therefore get past the guards. We had fun breathing the fresh air among the plants, gazing at the lavish lobby, walking on the jogging track, seeing the pool, and \*ahem\* playing on the playground.

As of October 22, Kendrea is reunited with her laptop! The repair was covered by a recall, so we didn&#8217;t have to pay anything. She is greatly enjoying the brand-new display.

We can’t repair the wifi, though, so for those of us in Eswatini and Nepal, uploading pictures takes practically as long as writing the actual blog post. We hope you appreciate them!

We saw the Himalayas from our rooftop! We thought they were out of view behind the foothills, but it turns out we can get a peek when the clouds, pollution, and dust are out of the way at the same time.
