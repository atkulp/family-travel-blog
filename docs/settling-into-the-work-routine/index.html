It was surprising to see a chapel in the same building as the Salvation Army clinic, but Swazis are much more comfortable with religion not just being confined to church buildings. They even start many meetings with a prayer. So far they have been a generally humble and unassuming people who are very friendly and open about their beliefs.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/35/img_20190821_1511015025958697422394118.jpg" alt="The Salvation Army clinic.

They have done a great job of reducing new infections through awareness campaigns and talking frankly about the risks of sexual activity. It’s been quite successful, but they continue to do everything they can to eradicate it.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/35/img_20190821_151353-12469269670772476461.jpg" alt="Sorry for the bad shot.

Many of the rural schools don’t have any computers so the kids don’t even have mouse skills. The program starts with beginner computer concepts (turning it on, typing, mouse, windows, files) moves on to Microsoft Office, and even offers a game development class. Certificates are given for completion, and the kids work on a resume to showcase their new skills. Karen, Noah, and I are excited about helping where we can!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/35/img_20190413_130059740614858071751986.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/35/responsive/img_20190413_130059740614858071751986-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/35/responsive/img_20190413_130059740614858071751986-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/35/responsive/img_20190413_130059740614858071751986-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/35/responsive/img_20190413_130059740614858071751986-lg.webp 1024w"></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="/tags/africa/index.html">africa</a></li><li><a href="/tags/eswatini/index.html">eswatini</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="/my-first-day-at-work-zui-chu-nori/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">My first day at work, 最初の日</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="/rangjung-yeshe-orientation/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Rangjung Yeshe Orientation</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="/authors/arian-and-karen/index.html" class="invert" title="Arian and Karen">Arian and Karen</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/first-week-of-work/index.html" class="invert">First week of work!</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-02T04:13">September 2, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/my-first-day-at-work-zui-chu-nori/index.html" class="invert">My first day at work, 最初の日</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-23T08:30">August 23, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
