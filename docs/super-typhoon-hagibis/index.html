The typhoon caused massive damage to certain parts of the country, killed a number of people, and caused flooding that lasted for quite a while. Thankfully, by the time the typhoon got to us, it had lost some of it’s oomph and we just got lots of rain.</p><p>The original predicted path for the Super Typhoon Hagibis had it hitting Tokyo and then sort of bouncing off and going back out to sea. That obviously didn’t happen though, and instead it hit Tokyo, went up the mainland, and back out to sea after hitting Hokkaido to the north. Though the path wasn’t what people were expecting, we still didn’t get hit very hard and only had minor flooding for a day or two.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/36/IMG_20191013_135537881_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="One end of the parking lot at Daily Port, a grocery store we frequent." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135537881_HDR-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135537881_HDR-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135537881_HDR-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135537881_HDR-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>That said… people were definitely scared and we didn’t know what to expect. We kept getting emergency texts and emergency broadcast announcements (over loudspeakers) warning us that the conditions had gotten worse and that various nearby towns were either evacuating or opening shelters due to flooding. Not to mention that we live about 3 blocks from the river, so if the levees hadn’t held or hadn’t been high enough, we would have been in a world of hurt.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/36/Screenshot_20191012-210853.png" alt="One of the many emergency alerts we got." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/36/responsive/Screenshot_20191012-210853-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/36/responsive/Screenshot_20191012-210853-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/36/responsive/Screenshot_20191012-210853-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/36/responsive/Screenshot_20191012-210853-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>We did pack go backs and made sure to have some food, water, and clothing, as well as some books and stuff just in case we got the alert to evacuate, but it never came to that. As it started raining harder and harder, we walked down our covered stairs a few times and ran across the street to watch the water level rising. It was pretty incredible how quickly the water level rose in our little stream.</p><p>When we decided to go to sleep for the night, it was a little concerning again because not all of our windows seal completely and though the wind wasn’t as bad as it could be, it was still stronger than it had been during our time here. We did see some water in the tracks of two of our windows in the evening, but by morning everything was still dry inside. Also, our screens blew around and made some noise, but again, nothing was damaged in the morning.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/36/IMG_20191013_143039535_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="Temporary barrier put across a walkway down to the river front.

Our side of the river didn’t have much for flooding, we have more fields mixed in to the city to absorb water, but the other side didn’t fare as well. The river near us rose maybe 3-4 meters (3-4 yards) and Sanuma had lots of roads that were under about 8 cm (2-3 in) of water, though that didn’t stop traffic from continuing on through like normal.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/36/IMG_20191013_135459850_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="Very flooded road" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135459850_HDR-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135459850_HDR-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135459850_HDR-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_135459850_HDR-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/36/IMG_20191013_142612742-scaled.jpg" alt="Even more flooded road!" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_142612742-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_142612742-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_142612742-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/36/responsive/IMG_20191013_142612742-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Church was cancelled in the town it was supposed to be in last weekend and was instead held in Ishinomaki. We weren’t sure we’d be able to make it since there are lots of sections that go through fields and we didn’t know how flooded it would be. Also, Google didn’t do a good job of staying up-to-date with road closures due to flooding, so we really had no idea if we could make it. As such we just stayed in our area and took pictures to show you guys, our awesome readers!</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="/kancane-kancane-little-by-little/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Kancane kancane (little by little)</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="/cooking-in-japan-ri-ben-deliao-li-suru/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Cooking in Japan – 日本で料理する</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
