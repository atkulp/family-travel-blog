Entrance to the Gardens is free, but you need to pay to enter some portions. It was too much money to enter the indoor greenhouses, but we did decide to do the hanging bridge in the Supertree Grove.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/17/IMG_20190817_141521-scaled.jpg" alt="The plants are beautiful from above!" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_141521-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_141521-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_141521-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_141521-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>After marveling at the cleanliness of the Gardens, we took the subway to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffles_Hotel">Raffles Hotel</a>. The whole subway experience was much closer to an airport tram than a US public transit vibe. We were shocked when we saw a single q-tip on the ground, since it was the only hint of litter. We ate some very good and cheap food at an underground food court, then headed up to Raffles.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/17/IMG_20190817_153814-scaled.jpg" alt="Internal courtyard at Raffles" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_153814-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_153814-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_153814-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_20190817_153814-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>We tried to go to the Long Bar to try a Singapore Sling (exclusive mixed drink), but the line was too long for how much layover we had left.

Everything went smoothly as we re-entered the airport, boarded the plane to Kathmandu, and left the ground one last time.</p><h2>Kathmandu</h2><p>We landed at around 9pm local time and exited the plane straight to the tarmac. A bus came to pick us up and bring us to the terminal, where we filled out a form on a glitchy kiosk, paid the $125 visa fee, and went through customs (which was kind of a joke). It took us a while to all make it through the process, but when we finished, we got on a taxi and had the strangest transit experience yet. Kendrea made the mistake of using the bathroom in the airport.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/17/img_3820-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Inside was a squat toilet and no toilet paper." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/17/responsive/img_3820-1-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/17/responsive/img_3820-1-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/17/responsive/img_3820-1-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/17/responsive/img_3820-1-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>When we all reconvened after customs, we got on a taxi and had the strangest transit experience yet.</p><p>Many of the roads here are dirt and not exactly flat. There are usually no lines on the road. You don’t need a license to drive. Most people don’t wear seatbelts, and some cars (like the taxi) have them inaccessible under the aftermarket seats. Over half of the vehicles are motorcycles. Many of the cars are manuals with small tires (so you feel the bumps more). There are dogs, people, and sometimes even goats and cows in the road. Instead of slowing down before going around a blind corner, people just honk to announce their presence. If someone is driving too slowly, they’ll get honked at when overtaken. It’s common to swerve into oncoming traffic to go around someone who’s slow, a sleeping dog, or a pothole.</p><p>Basically, the whole thing physically felt like a rollercoaster and emotionally was just a big game of trust. A taxi driver, of all people, should be pretty good at navigating the chaos, right?</p><p>We arrived at Shechen Guest House (where we’ll stay until we move in with our host families) after closing time, so we had to kind of holler at the gate for someone to come. We entered a courtyard and picked up our key, then went to our room.</p><p>We found two pretty normal-looking beds that turned out to not have normal mattresses. They’re basically mats rolled out on the bed frame, so they’re pretty firm. Comfy enough, but certainly not what we’re used to in the US. We took a cold shower and went to sleep.</p><p>(Sorry for the lack of Kathmandu pictures. It was dark and we were very tired. More pictures to come later!)</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="/tags/nepal/index.html">nepal</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="/corvallis-to-singapore/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Corvallis to Singapore</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="/kathmandu-and-boudha-too/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">Kathmandu and Boudha Too</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="/authors/gabriel-and-kendrea/index.html" class="invert" title="Gabriel and Kendrea">Gabriel and Kendrea</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/kathmandu-and-boudha-too/index.html" class="invert">Kathmandu and Boudha Too</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-21T07:03">August 21, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/corvallis-to-singapore/index.html" class="invert">Corvallis to Singapore</a></h4><time datetime="2019-08-17T00:34">August 17, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
