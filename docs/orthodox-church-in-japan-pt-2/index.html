Unfortunately, this was the first consecration I’ve been to, and my liturgical Japanese is… lacking.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_125423658_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="The exterior of the new building as seen from their hall" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_125423658_HDR-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_125423658_HDR-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_125423658_HDR-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_125423658_HDR-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>The building was pretty darn full when we arrived, there were probably about 100 people there. This event had been announced all over the area so we drove an hour and there were definitely people that came from farther. There was also the choir from Sendai which came to sing and we really appreciated them!</p><p>Concelebrating was His Eminence, Bishop Seraphim of Sendai, 5 priests from the area including our Father Luke, the protodeacon from Sendai, and a collection of alter servers (no subdeacons though).</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_093002548-scaled.jpg" alt="*Right after the bishop entered the building, everyone walked to the front and they sang a bunch of stuff. *" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_093002548-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_093002548-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_093002548-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_093002548-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>There was a whole lot of stuff going on that neither Lilly nor I could understand, but there were several parts of the consecration service that we still managed to figure out! The first was when all of a sudden there was a lot of very loud banging from behind the alter, then the bishop opened the beautiful gates wearing an apron over his robes and you could see the wooden structure of the alter being assembled. I couldn’t quite get a picture of it since I didn’t know it was coming ☹️</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_103105519_HDR-scaled.jpg" alt="Things happening at the doors to the church." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_103105519_HDR-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_103105519_HDR-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_103105519_HDR-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_103105519_HDR-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>After the consecration was done, they launched into liturgy which was our first hierarchical service here. Things went pretty much as expected, though it was fun to see everything in Japanese with so many clergy. We’ve definitely gotten used to small, intimate services during our time here.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/download_20190923_132255-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Eagle rug" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/download_20190923_132255-1-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/download_20190923_132255-1-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/download_20190923_132255-1-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/download_20190923_132255-1-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_110819576-scaled.jpg" alt="The protodeacon wrangling the oversized gospel." sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_110819576-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_110819576-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_110819576-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_110819576-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_112407859-scaled.jpg" alt="Eis pola eti déspota!" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_112407859-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_112407859-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_112407859-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_112407859-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>Finally, agreed the service was done, everyone went outside and took a picture of everyone in front of the new church. After that, we ask headed over to a banquet at a nearby hotel where we were fed some pretty yummy food and listened to lots of speeches.</p><p>During the banquet we talked to some Russian ladies that were all excited to talk to the young Russian family that had showed up. Unfortunately for them, neither of us knows Russian, so they were a bit sad and surprised. One of them spoke English though and we talked for a bit. We made some friends from the Sendai area!</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_132333427-scaled.jpg" alt="The hall we ate in and listened to speeches in" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_132333427-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_132333427-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_132333427-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_132333427-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p><p>We also got to talk to a French dude who worked on the iconostasis. Apparently a Japanese-French dude started a carpentry shop after moving to Japan from France. He then attracted some French people that wanted to learn Japanese carpentry and they work mostly on shrines. When they heard there was an Orthodox church starting in town, they wanted to take the job. The guy said that it was a really fun job, that they all really enjoyed making the iconostasis, and that they hoped they would get the opportunity to work on Orthodox churches again in the future. He also said that they used many, many different kinds of Japanese woods to make iconostasis and that it was fun to weave Japanese culture and orthodoxy together.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/media/posts/32/IMG_20190915_115426672-scaled.jpg" alt="A somewhat cleaner view of the iconostasis" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="/media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_115426672-scaled-xs.webp 300w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_115426672-scaled-sm.webp 480w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_115426672-scaled-md.webp 768w, /media/posts/32/responsive/IMG_20190915_115426672-scaled-lg.webp 1024w"></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2024</div><div class="content__footer__col"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="/tags/japan/index.html">japan</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="content__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="/waterfalls-and-zebras/index.html" class="invert" rel="prev">Waterfalls and zebras</a></h5></div><div class="content__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="/what-were-here-for-classes/index.html" class="invert" rel="next">What We’re Here For: Classes</a></h5></div></nav><div class="content__bio"><div><h3><a href="/authors/damian-and-lilly/index.html" class="invert" title="Damian and Lilly">Damian and Lilly</a></h3></div></div><div class="content__related"><h3 class="u-h5">Related posts</h3><div class="content__related__wrap"><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/family-christmas-in-japan/index.html" class="invert">Family Christmas in Japan</a></h4><time datetime="2020-01-03T09:31">January 3, 2020</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/orthodox-church-in-japan-pt-1/index.html" class="invert">Orthodox Church in Japan – Pt. 1</a></h4><time datetime="2019-09-16T00:56">September 16, 2019</time></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h4><a href="/cooking-in-japan-ri-ben-deliao-li-suru/index.html" class="invert">Cooking in Japan – 日本で料理する</a></h4><time datetime="2019-10-26T12:08">October 26, 2019</time></figcaption></figure></div></div></footer></article><div class="banner banner--after-content"><dialog id="lightbox"><img></dialog><script>const lightbox = document.querySelector('#lightbox');
